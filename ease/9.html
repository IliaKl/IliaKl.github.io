<p><b>Chapter
9. Room Investigations</b></p>
<p>Now it
is time to investigate the many ways EASE and EASE JR offer to simulate and
display the acoustical and electro-acoustical per-formance of the room and its
loudspeaker system.</p>
<p>In this
section, we will cover all the investigations that are available to both EASE
and EASE JR users. In the next section, Advanced Acoustical Investigations,
we’ll take up the investigations available only to EASE users.</p>
<p><b>New
Mapping Conventions</b></p>
<p>Before
we go on let’s explore several of EASE 4.3’s significant improvements.</p>
<p>EASE
and EASE JR 4.3 now offer a choice of Mapping Conventions. Previous ver-sions
used a Multi-Tone excitation signal for the simulations; all power was inserted
in all frequency bands. In this method the excitation signal is comparable to a
den-sity signal with a W<u>hite Noise spectrum.</u></p>
<p><img
width=249 height=292 src="E3.files/image038.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE
4.3 introduces a Broadband Pink Noise excitation signal and sums the results
according to RTA conventions, a technique commonly employed by RTA ‘s using a
Pink Noise signal.</p>
<p>A
detailed discussion of these two methods is beyond the scope of this Tutorial.</p>
<p>The use
of Broadband Pink Noise also enables EASE to offer accurate A-Weighted response
curves.</p>
<p>The
default method for all new projects is the Broadband Pink Noise method.
Proj-ects created in earlier versions of EASE will open using the Multi-Tone
method. These projects mapping method can be switched to Broadband Pink Noise
in the Settings tab of the Room Data folder shown here.</p>
<p>To
access the Settings tab,either select <i>Room Info/ Data</i> from the Main <i>View</i>
pull down menu or right click on the screen in Edit Project and select <i>Room
Data</i> from the Mouse menu.</p>
<p><b>New
Level Conventions</b></p>
<p>The
change in Mapping Conventions also dictated a change in the Loudspeaker Level
Conventions to accommodate the Pink Noise signal.</p>
<p>Projects
created in earlier versions of EASE will open in 4.3 with the earlier
multi-tone Mapping settings. Projects created in 4.3 will open with the Mapping
Convention set to Broadband Pink Noise .</p>
<p>Note:If
you open an older project and switch to the Broad band Pink Noise mapping
method and enter either Area Mapping or Room Mapping, a prompt will ask you to
Check Data first. When you attempt to Check Data, a second prompt will inform
you that the loudspeaker power setting exceeds the maxi-mum power allowable for
Pink Noise Mapping. You will need to open Edit Project, select one of the
project’s loudspeakers, open its Properties folder and change its power level
settings.</p>
<p><img
width=161 height=105 src="E3.files/image039.jpg"></p>
<p>All the
Ele Power figures will be shown in red as an indication they are set to high;
see example on the next page. The easiest and recommended way to set the levels
to ones accept-able for Pink Noise Mapping is to press the <i>Flat Max</i>
button in the Level section.</p>
<p><img
width=266 height=109 src="E3.files/image040.jpg"></p>
<p>If the
project has more than one loudspeaker the Loudspeaker Power Exceeds Maximum
Power prompt will again appear; clicking <i>OK</i> will highlight a second
loudspeaker and open its Properties folder. Again select <i>Flat Ma</i>x and <i>OK</i>.
Ease will continue to step through the loudspeakers until all the power levels
have been adjusted to the Pink Noise level convention.. It really goes quite
fast.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=310 src="E3.files/image041.jpg"></p>
<p><b>New STI
Intelligibility Calculations</b></p>
<p>EASE
and EASE JR now calculate STI using the MTI (Modulation Tranfer Index) values
in accordance with the current IEC16 Standard IEC60268-16:2003. ALcons and
RaSTI intelligibility figures are then derived from the STI figures.</p>
<p>This
method allows EASE and EASE JR to caculate STI, ALcons and RaSTI
intelligibility projections in both open areas and closed spaces..</p>
<p><b>Area
Mapping</b></p>
<p>For the
first part of this exercise we will study Area Mapping using the Theater 1
example. Room Mapping will be covered later.</p>
<p><img
width=249 height=292 src="E3.files/image042.jpg"></p>
<p>Open
EASE, if it isn't already open, and either select <i>Open Project</i> from the <i>File</i>
pull down menu or use the desk top icons to find and select <i>Theater 1</i>.
When the Draw Room prompt appears answer <i>No</i>, unless you want to
reacquaint yourself with the room model. You do not need to Draw the room at
this time, Instead, you can go direct to the <i>Calculations</i> pull down menu
and select <i>Area Mapping</i>.</p>
<p>Before
we go on let’s check the default settings for the Mapping functions. They are
found in the Edit Data folder.</p>
<p>Either
select <i>Room Info/ Data</i> from the Main <i>View</i> pull down menu or right
click on the screen in Edit Project and select <i>Room Data</i> from the Mouse
menu.</p>
<p>The
Settings tab contains the radio buttons that allow you to select either
Broad-band Pink Noise or Multi-Tone excitation signal. Broadband Pink Noise is
recom-mended. The Settings tab also includes controls for the size of the
Loudspeaker Symbol used in Edit Project and for the programs Tolerance for
Plane Faces. We suggest using the default settings for these controls.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p><b>EASE
4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img
width=666 height=314 src="E3.files/image043.jpg"></p>
<p>Let’s
check out the Mapping and Noise tabs next. Click on the <i>Mapping</i> tab.</p>
<p>The <i>Split
Time [ms]</i> setting determines which reflections are considered di-rect sound
during the calculations and which ones are reverberant sound. Since the D/R
(Direct Sound / Reverberant Sound) ratio is a key factor in de-termining
intelligibility and in evaluating other aspects of the system's per-formance
this is an important setting.</p>
<p>Early
reflections, those arriving within 15 to 40 msec of the direct sound, im-prove
intelligibility while reflections arriving later detract from intelligibility.
We suggest 35 msec as a good compromise between the 15 msec figure fa-vored by
some acousticians and the 40 ms favored by others. Change the setting from 10
to 35.</p>
<p><i>Map
With Shadow </i>introduces the effects of any shadowing into the simula-tion. In
the Theater1 model, for example, the effects of the shadowing caused by the
balcony are visible only if Shadowing is turned On. Since simulations run
without shadowing are misleading if there are obstructions in the room, many
users automatically turn Shadowing On all the time.</p>
<p><img
width=249 height=292 src="E3.files/image044.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Interference</i>
section establishes how the energy levels are calculated. When <i>Interference
Sum</i> is not checked, the energy levels are calculated by simple energy
addition of the direct sound from one or more loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Mathematically,
this translates into a &quot;sum of the squares&quot; calculation where the
contribution from a source is first squared and then added to the squared
contributions from other sources. All phase information is lost in the process.</p>
<p>Turning
<i>Interference Sum</i> On by placing a check in the box reverses the
mathematical operation and all source contributions are added first in a
complex manner and then the resulting complex sum squared. This retains all the
phase effects such as cancellations and additions. Run a Direct Sound
simulation with both Interference Sum settings and you'll see a vast
difference. Note that after you have changed the settings, you need to rerun
the simulation to actually see the results.</p>
<p>The <i>Pot.
Energy</i> and <i>Kin. Energy</i> options allows the calculations to be run
using only the pressure part (potential) of the energy or the velocity
(kinetic) part or both parts when both are checked. A thorough explanation of
this as-pect of the program is beyond the scope of this manual. Our
recommenda-tion is to use <i>Interference Sum</i> and the <i>1/3rd Octave</i>
bandwidth.</p>
<p><img
width=249 height=292 src="E3.files/image045.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Noise</i>
tab allows you to set the default noise levels for the project. Note how easy
it is to raise or lower individual frequency levels or all levels
simul-taneously by using the <i>Level</i> buttons.</p>
<p>The <i>Load
File</i> icon allows you to import measured noise data if it is available and
use it in the simulations. You can also <i>Save</i> the noise data file and
then use it at a later date in another project.</p>
<p>We
reviewed the Room RT tab earlier while constructing our Model_1 Room. If you
skipped that portion of the tutorial, return to page 62 to review it.</p>

<p><b>Chapter

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Now it’s
time to open the Area Mapping window. Return to the <i>Main</i> window and
select <i>Area Mapping</i> from the <i>Calculations</i> pull dopwn menu.</p>
<p><img
width=411 height=296 src="E3.files/image046.jpg"></p>
<p>it’s
possible your screen may not show the Audience Area names. If it does not, go
to the <i>Items</i> pull down menu and turn on <i>Audience</i> <i>Area Labels </i>or
use the Tool Bar icon to turn them On. Note that the four Audience Areas are
not simply labeled A1, A2, etc. EASE allows<i> </i>you to use labels that are
more descriptive and we strongly advise you to do so for the Audience Areas,
Loudspeakers and Listener Seats. It makes everything so much easier.</p>
<p><b>Moving
Audience Areas</b></p>
<p>Notice
that the Audience Area labeled BAL, the balcony Audience Area, does not overlap
or shadow the two main floor Audience Areas (areas A2 &amp; Main) as it does in
the actual room. This is because EASE allows you to move Audience Areas for
display purposes. If you want to try this out, return to the <i>Main</i> menu
and open the <i>Edit Project</i> program. Then select <i>Area Layout</i> from
the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu to view the Audience Areas. Pick one of the
Audience Areas and then select <i>Move</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu.
The cursor will now turn from a pointer into a pair of pliers. Use the pliers
to grab the selected Audience Area and move it around the screen. It's that
easy to re-arrange Audience Areas for easy viewing.</p>
<p><b>Mapping</b></p>
<p>Clicking
on any one of the Mapping icons in the Tool Bar section of the Area Mapping
window will initiate the Mapping procedure and open the Settings dialog box.</p>
<p><img
width=264 height=267 src="E3.files/image047.jpg"></p>
<p>This
window and the ones that follow remind you of the parameters that need to be
set up before a simulation. The Settings tab is where you select the frequency
of the simulation, choose what loudspeaker(s) will be used and decide upon the
resolution.</p>
<p>You
also are presented with the choice of running a <i>Single</i> map or of using
the <i>All</i> <i>Mappings </i>feature. When<i> All Mapping </i>is selected,
the program gathers all the<i> </i>data it needs to quickly display all the
simulations available at any frequency. This is a great time saver when you are
doing a detailed analysis. We suggest using the <i>All Mapping</i> option and
selecting <i>Direct SPL</i> as the measure to show first.</p>
<p>Clicking
on the Loudspeaker button opens a list of the loudspeakers used in the model
and gives you the opportunity to select which ones will be used in the
sim-ulation.</p>
<p>We’ll
discuss the Resolution later. For now accept the default setting. Click on <i>Next
</i>to advance to the next setup window.</p>

<p><img
width=666 height=290 src="E3.files/image048.jpg"></p>
<p>The
Items tab lets you choose what Audience Areas and Listener Seats will be
included in the simulation.</p>
<p>Click
on the <i>Aud. Are</i>a button and select all four of the Audience Areas. Note
that the easy way to do this is to right click on the <i>OK</i> button to
select all of them and then left click on <i>OK</i>. To select several of the
Areas, hold down the <i>Ctrl</i> button and make your selection using the left
Mouse button.</p>
<p><img
width=264 height=267 src="E3.files/image049.jpg"></p>
<p>Then
either open the <i>Noise</i> tab or click on <i>Next</i> to open it.</p>
<p>The
Noise setup window allows you to set the noise levels (modify the de-fault
settings established in Room Data) that will be used in intelligibility
cal-culations. These are important to accurate Intelligibility projections, so
don’t overlook them. Accept the default settings for now and click on <i>Next</i>.</p>
<p><img
width=264 height=267 src="E3.files/image050.jpg"></p>
<p>The
Calculations window allows you to make further adjustments to the de-fault
settings established in Room Data. Shadowing can be turned On or Off. When
Shadowing is On, EASE takes into account the shadowing effect of any objects in
the room, such as columns and balconies. When it's Off, it doesn't.</p>
<p>Under <i>Interference</i>,
make sure <i>Interference Sum</i> and <i>Third Octave</i> are checked and the <i>Split
Time</i> is set to 35. Refer back to page 182 for further information on these
settings if you feel you need it. For now, accept the de-fault settings.</p>
<p>Finally,
click on <i>OK</i> to run the simulation.</p>

<p>It will
take a minute or two for the program to gather all the data need to render the
Direct SPL Map. Note that the program scans each Au-dience Area individually
and then goes on to the next Audience Area. When the simulation is complete,
the window shown below will open. Notice that the View Calculations control
window essentially covers the actual SPL Map.</p>
<p><img

<p><b>Display
Methods</b></p>
<p>Before
we go on let’s take a look at the various mapping display methods offered by
EASE. Control of the display method is provided by the four Tool Bar display
icons or by using the View pull down menu.</p>
<p>The
default display method and the method we have used so far in the Tutorial is
commonly called Color Patches; the View pull down menu lists it as Patch Grid
and Painted.</p>
<p>Another
method uses Isobars instead of Patches. The isobar graphic below was made by
turning Painted (Color) off and Labels On.</p>
<p>Note
that if you going to use a black &amp; white Isobar display, Labels must be on
or all you will see is blank areas.</p>
<p><img
width=504 height=310 src="E3.files/image053.jpg"></p>
<p>The
next graphic was made with with Patch Grid turned On and Coloring turned Off.
It plainly shows why the method is called Patches or Patch Grid. EASE scans
each square (Patch) sequentially to develop the display.</p>
<p><img
width=504 height=310 src="E3.files/image054.jpg"></p>
<p>The
size of each Patch determines the resolution and the amount of time needed to
do the calculation. The smaller the Patch size, the higher the resolution and
the longer the calculation takes.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>Chapter
9: Room Investigatiions</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Control
of the resolution is provided by the first Calculation Parameters setup window.
See below.</p>
<p><img
width=332 height=332 src="E3.files/image055.jpg"></p>
<p>We have
been using 1 for the patch size and 1 dB for the Isoline display. The display
shown below was made using a patch size of 3. No-tice the loss of resolution.</p>
<p>Notice
that the setup window also contains a <i>Use Area Setting</i> check box and a <i>L/8</i>
button. The Properties window for Audience Areas al-lows you to define the scan
resolution for each individual Audience Area. Checking <i>Use Area Settings</i>
tells the program to use these set-tings instead of the Patch Size setting.
Pressing the L/8 button changes the resolution (the patch size) to 1/8
wavelength at the frequency chosen for the simulation (.14 feet at 1000 Hz and
.07 feet at 2000 Hz, for example).</p>
<p><img
width=504 height=310 src="E3.files/image056.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that in all the Mapping displays, you can obtain a readout of the level at any
point by left clicking on that point; right clicking will both readout the
level and write it on the display.</p>

at the location shown.</p>
<p><img
width=391 height=307 src="E3.files/image057.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
the four color bars to the right of the graph. The top three allow you to look
at the <i>Average</i>, <i>Minimum</i> and Maximum SPL levels for the area
scanned. The bottom one allows you to turn off the red SPL curve for the
individual location. The result of turning Average, Minimum and <i>Maximum</i>
On is shown below.</p>
<p><img
width=391 height=307 src="E3.files/image058.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that moving the cursor to any point on one of the curves will produce a readout
in the Cursor field at the bottom of the window giving you the frequency and
Direct SPL level at that point.</p>
<p>The
View section in the lower left of the window allows you to change the display
window from a graph to a tabular listing of the same infor-mation or to a side

<p>The <i>Send

processing.</p>

<p>The <i>File
Info</i> tab contains a statistical summary of the setup parameters, including
the loudspeakers used, their locations and output levels in an ASCII text
format that can be saved and opened in other programs and then printed.</p>
<p>The <i>Echogram</i>
tab is empty at this time and will be until an Echogram is created. Echograms
are a feature available only to AURA users.</p>
<p>We'll
cover them later in the AURA section of this manual.</p>
<p>The <i>Distribution</i>
tab opens the distribution window which displays a bar graph representation of
the selected parameter, Direct SPL at 1000 Hz in the example shown below. As
you can see, it enables you to quickly determine what percentage of the mapped
areas fall within cer-tain criteria. In this example, 90 % of the total area
falls within 94 to 98 dB (plus or minus 2 dB) .</p>
<p>This
window is your answer to the specifications that call for coverage to be
&quot;flat within +/-__dB&quot;. Use the Cursor and Cursor value readout below

<p>Now,
lets take a closer look at the top Tool Bar portion of the View Calculation
window.</p>
<p><img
width=595 height=103 src="E3.files/image061.jpg"></p>
<p>The
large button on the left (the + button in the above graphic) opens and closes
the bottom Evaluation Display portion of the window. It al-lows you to close
the bottom portion of the window, so you can see the Map.</p>
<p>The <i>Open
Folder</i> icon is used to open previously created .emp Mapping files for
review. The <i>Floppy Disk</i> icon button next to it is used to save the
current simulation as a .emp Map file. The <i>Notepad</i> icon is used to save
the current file in an ASCII .txt format. The <i>Waste Basket</i> icon is used
to delete the current simulation file from the View Calculation module and
choose another one from the File Listing drop down menu.</p>
<p>The
left colorful Map icon is used to draw a new Map. Lets try it out. Open the
drop down menu directly below the Redraw button and se-lect a new simulation
type. Note that you have a wide variety to choose from. Selecting one, STI for
example, and then pressing the <i>Re-draw </i>button will quickly produce an
STI map in place of the Direct SPL map. Since we used All Mapping, the program
doesn't have to rerun<i> </i>the entire simulation. All it has to do is scan
the data it collected and render the drawing, a process that takes only a few
seconds.</p>
<p>The
right colorful Map icon allows the selection of all simulations and all
frequencies and frequency resolutions. Pressing the icon, opens a drop down
menu giving you the choice of <i>Render All</i> or <i>Send to EASEPaD</i>. <i>Render
All</i> will render all the Maps selected and <i>Send To</i> <i>EASEPaD </i>will
both render the Maps and send them to<i> EASEPaD </i>for further processing.</p>
<p>Selecting
one of the two choices will open the selection menu shown below. The buttons
and the selection fields make it easy for you to select the specific Maps you
want to see or save. Try it out. You'll find it a very useful tool for putting
together presentations.</p>

<p>The <i>Frequency</i>
drop down menu allows you to quickly select the center point of the frequency
band that will be used in the next simulation while the <i>Bandwidth</i> drop
down menu determines the width of the frequency band.</p>
<p>Note
that you have a choice of Third Octave, One Octave, Three Octaves, Broadband
and a number of specific frequencies. One Octave will average the results over
one octave, while Broadband will show the results averaged across the entire
spectrum. Custom bandwidths can be generated using the <i>Frequency</i> menu to
set the lower frequency limit and the numerical frequency listings to set the
upper limit, 1000 Hz plus to 5000 Hz for example.</p>
<p>The wider
the bandwidth, the less apparent the effects of comb filtering. As a general
rule, simulations run with a 3 octave bandwidth come closest to simulating the
variations you will hear while &quot;walking&quot; the room during the final
commissioning.</p>
<p>The
location section of the tool bars shown below identifies the location of the
graph shown in the display section of the window and allows you to change the
location.</p>

<p>Before
we go on let’s take time to save the mapping file. You may have noticed that in
the View Calculations window the word “Temporary” followed the name of the
calculation. This is the program’s way of telling you that the Mapping file you
created has not been saved and will be lost if you close it without saving it.</p>

<p><b>C
(Clarity) Calculations</b></p>
<p>C
(Clarity) calculations offer several ways to evaluate the acoustic performance
of a room and its loudspeaker system. They are widely used in Europe.</p>
<p><b>C7 </b>is
equivalent to the D/R ratio widely used in the U.S. and represents another way
to look at the strength of the Direct Sound field. It<b> </b>displays in dB the
ratio of direct and reverberant sound using a Split Time of 7 ms. Values above
-15 dB show good localization (a good D/R ratio). The closer the value comes to
0, the better the localization.</p>
<p><b>C50 </b>is used
to project speech intelligibility. It displays the ratio of energy before and
after 50 ms; i.e., its similar to Alcons with a 50 ms Split<b> </b>Time. Any
value above 0 dB in a room with normal reverberation represents good
intelligibility. In rooms with higher than normal reverbera-tion, any value
above -5 dB is considered good.</p>
<p><b>C80 </b>is
often called a clarity ratio. It uses an 80 ms Split Time to predict the
articulation (clarity) of different types of music. In other words, it<b> </b>provides
a look at the room's musical performance. A brief explanation follows.</p>
<p>Musical
instruments can be divided into four basic types:</p>
<p>1. Blown instruments (e.g., organ, tuba, clarinet, etc.)
These instruments have a slow attack and slow decay.</p>
<p>2. Bowed instruments (e.g., violin, viola, cello, bass
etc.) These instruments have slightly quicker attack and slow decay.</p>
<p>3. Plucked instrument (e.g., guitar, string bass,
harpsichord, etc.) These instruments have quick attack and medium slow decay.</p>
<p>4. Percussive
instruments (e.g., piano, drums, electronic instruments, xylophone etc.) These
instruments have a quick attack and a quick decay.</p>

<p>The
scale for interpreting C80 follows:</p>
<p>• 0 +/- 2 dB is ideal for organ or blown instruments played
at a slow rate of speed. This is perfect for organ recital halls</p>
<p>• 2
+/-2 dB is ideal for bowed instruments and is best shown by a room made for
classical or symphonic instrumental music. The speed of the music is quicker.
The music of live choirs is also good at this level. This would be good for
traditional churches</p>
<p>• 4
+/-2 dB is ideal for plucked instruments. The speed of the music is quicker as
well as more modern. This would be described as folk music or in churches as
Light Contemporary. This would also cover light popular music such as Light
Jazz</p>
<p>• 6
+/-2 dB is ideal for percussive instruments. This can be described best as Rock
and Roll. In churches this would be known as Full Contemporary.</p>
<p>For
good musical performance, the number should not exceed +8 dB at any location. A
C80 plot for Theater1 follows.</p>
<p><img

<p><b>Csplit</b></p>
<p>Csplit
offers a way to look at the energy ratios before and after the selected Split
Time. It gives you the opportunity to see the effect of dif-ferent Split time
settings. The selected Split Time in this case, of course, is the Split Time we
set up before running the All Mapping simula-tion (35 msec.)</p>
<p><b>D/R
Ratios</b></p>
<p>D/R
Ratio shows the ratio of direct to reverberant sound in terms of dB. Zero dB
indicates the sound levels are the same. Numbers less than 0 indicate the
reverberant sound level is higher than the direct sound level. Numbers greater
than 0 indicate the direct sound level is higher. Note that in Theater 1 the
reverberant level is higher than the direct sound level. This is not unusual.</p>

<p><b>Critical
Distance</b></p>
<p>Critical
Distance displays the ratio of Direct to Reverberant sound in terms of
distance. Critical Distance is the distance in space at which the Direct and
Reverberant sound levels are equal. This is displayed as a 1. Figures of more
than 1 indicate the reverberant sound level at this distance is higher than the
direct sound coming from the loudspeakers. Figures lower than 1 indicate that
at this distance from the Loudspeakers the Direct Sound level is higher than
the level of the reverberant field.</p>

<p>The L7,
L50 and L80 simulations allow you to look at the sum of the direct and
reverberant sound energy within the specified time; for ex-ample the first 7
msec when L7 is used. Lsplit uses the split time set up for the simulation, in
this case 35 msec. In other words, Pressure Level simulations are similar to
the C7, C50, C80, Csplit calculations, except they show you the total sound
during the specified period.</p>
<p><b>Total
SPL (SUM)</b></p>
<p>Sum or
Total SPL displays the sum of the Direct and Reverberant sound energy in dB. In

<p>We'll
use Area Mapping. Return to the <i>Main</i> window and select <i>Area Mapping</i>
from the <i>Calculations</i> pull down menu. Then, select either Direct SPL or
Recalculate and proceed through the setup windows. The program needs to know
what loudspeakers will be used in the au-ralization.</p>
<p>When

<p><b>Ray
Tracing</b></p>
<p>Ray
Tracing is an often used concept in CAD programs for the rendering of
illuminated objects. In EASE, Ray Tracing is used to study the propagation of
sound rays. Rays are released into the room and each Ray's path is traced until
it reaches predetermined limits.</p>
<p>Ray
Tracing allows you to study reflection patterns within the room by emitting
rays whose reflection paths can be viewed and investigated. The key words in
the previous sentence are &quot;reflection patterns&quot;. The Ray Tracing
routine does not allow you to investigate reflections that hit a specific spot
within the room. Comparatively few rays are needed in Ray Tracing to produce
the quantity of rays needed for reflection pattern studies and for the Movie
module. Consequently, Ray Tracing reflection pattern studies are relatively
quick to make. Only a few hundred rays and low order reflection orders are
needed. The maximum for EASE JR users is 1000 rays and Third-Order reflections.</p>
<p><img
width=198 height=121 src="E3.files/image079.jpg"></p>
<p>To
start Ray Tracing, if the <i>Edit Project</i> module is open close or minimize
it and then return to the <i>Main</i> menu and open the <i>Calculations</i>
pull down menu. Selecting <i>Ray Tracing</i> will open the Prompt shown to the
right.</p>
<p>It's

<p>The <i>Loudspeaker</i>
and <i>Lspk Group</i> but-tons are used to select the loudspeakers that will be
used in the simulation, while the <i>Rays per Loudspeaker</i> field deter-mines
how many rays will be emitted by each loudspeaker. The thing to remem-ber while
making these setups is that the larger the number of loudspeakers and the more
rays emitted by each loud-speaker, the longer the calculation time.</p>
<p><img
width=458 height=262 src="E3.files/image081.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Trace
Control By</i> section sets up the ray cutoff parameters for the simulation. <i>Order
</i>determines how many reflections<i> </i>(bounces) the program will trace,
before going on to the next ray. For reflection pattern studies no more than
Third-Order</p>
<p>reflections
(the maximum allowed by EASE JR) are needed.</p>
<p><i>Time </i>establishes
the length of the investigation. Lengths of 100 to 300 ms are typical for Ray
Tracing, although shorter and longer times<i> </i>are possible. <i>Loss</i>
cuts off the ray trace when the SPL has dropped the specified amount. This is
typically set at 60 dB.</p>
<p><i>Directed
Emission </i>produces a weighted display used primarily to enhance simple
reflection studies and Movie presentations.</p>
<p>The <i>Tracing
Options</i> section determines how the rays will be displayed and whether or
not they will be saved in a <i>Trace</i> file. When <i>Draw</i> <i>Trace Rays </i>is
checked the program will draw the rays in the<i> View Project </i>screen. The
rays will appear in rapid order on the screen as their<i> </i>paths are
calculated by the program unless <i>Show Every Ray</i> is also checked.
Checking <i>Show Every Ray</i> allows you to manually step through and observe
the rays one by one as they are calculated.</p>
<p>When <i>Brief
Ray Info</i> is checked, information on each Ray's path will flash across the
Ray Tracing Control window while the window color flashes with the Ray's color.</p>
<p><i>Make
Trace File </i>saves the results of the simulation in a .trc Trace file for
later viewing and analysis using<i> View Trace File</i>. View Trace File<i> </i>provides
many more viewing options than Ray Tracing, including the ability to
individually look at each loudspeakers reflection pattern.</p>
<p>Because
of this, many experienced users will run an extensive trace file using all of
the loudspeakers and then use View Trace File to ana-lyze the reflection patterns.</p>
<p>Let's
try out Ray Tracing. For our first try, we'll use only the Main floor and Balc
De-layL, Balc DelayR and Balc Delay Ctr loudspeaker and 500 rays. Press the <i>Loudspeaker
</i>button and select them and<i> </i>insert 500 into the <i>Rays per
Loudspeaker</i> fierld..</p>
<p><img
width=458 height=262 src="E3.files/image082.jpg"></p>
<p>Then
set the <i>Order</i> to 3, the <i>Time</i> to 200 ms and the <i>Loss [dB]</i>
to 60 dB. We'll use <i>Directed Emission</i>, too, as we'll be using<i> </i>the
Movie feature shortly. Note that you have to put a check in the <i>Time [ms]</i>
and <i>Loss [dB] </i>boxes before you can fill in the<i> </i>fields. Then put
checks into <i>Draw Trace</i> <i>Rays </i>and<i> Brief Ray Info</i>. The setup
menu<i> </i>should look like this when you are done.</p>

<p>Before
you click on <i>OK</i>, make sure you can see the View Project window. You'll
may want to rearrange the screen to get a better view of it.</p>
<p>Now
click on <i>OK</i>. Notice that the room quickly fills up with yellow and
magenta rays. The magenta color rays are the programs way of telling you that
the time window is too short; that many of the rays are being cut off by the
time limitation before their trace is completed. Do the Ray Trace again with
the <i>Time</i> set to 400 ms and you'll see the magenta rays disappear, an
indication they are now being allowed to finish their trace. Note that the Ray

notice that as soon as you <i>OK</i> the <i>Computation Ready</i> prompt that

happens if you attempt to rotate or enlarge the room to get a better view of
the rays. The way around this is to use the <i>Make</i> <i>Trace File </i>option,
so most users will automatically make a Trace File every time they do an
investigation. Its easier to work with and more<i> </i>flexible. Let's see how

the Options folder <i>(F9)</i> and select <i>1. Reflection Face Color</i> <i>Only.
OK </i>the change to return to the Rays control window and select Ray Tracing
from the Rays pull down menu.</p>
<p>We want
to study the reflections from the Main Loudspeaker off the one side wall and
the ceiling. Insert 1 in the Trace Control Order field, 20 in the Rays per
Loudspeaker field and select the Main Loudspeaker. Under Tracing Options select
Make Trace File and proceed by fol-lowing the prompts.</p>
<p>You may
want to rerun the simulation using a few more Rays or 2nd order reflections to
gain further insight into the reflection pattern. It’s easy to do. The
simulation shown below was made with 40 Rays and 2nd order reflections.</p>

<p>Now,
let's move on to the Movie mode. Click on the Movie tab to open the Movie
Control screen shown below.</p>
<p><img
width=496 height=308 src="E3.files/image090.jpg"></p>
<p>This
screen allows you to control the movies length and the manner of presentation.
The <i>Fixed, Order, SPL</i> and <i>Loss</i> buttons select the na-ture of the
display. When <i>SP</i>L is checked, for example, the color of the rays will
change with their SPL level.</p>
<p>When <i>Beam</i>
is checked, the Movie will show the rays as beams. When it is not checked, only
the wavefront will be shown. The <i>Night</i> but-ton turns the display window
from its normal gray background color to a midnight blue that makes it easier
to see the rays.</p>
<p>We will
start by using <i>Loss</i> and <i>Beam</i>. Click on them to turn them On.</p>
<p>The
control buttons on the bottom allow you to <i>Start</i> and <i>Stop</i> the
movie, to <i>Step Forward</i> or <i>Step Back</i> through it and to <i>Pause</i>
in the pres-entation. <i>Wipe</i> clears the display of any previous
information.</p>
<p>Press
the <i>Start</i> button and watch the rays spread out into the room. You will
notice that the rays change color as they get further from the loudspeaker.
They are changing color to show the dB loss.</p>
<p>The
color codes for the <i>Loss</i>, <i>Order</i> and <i>SP</i>L displays can be
found and changed under the <i>Color</i> tab</p>
<p>Our
initial Trace File was was made using only 500 Rays from just the Main and
delayed Balcony Loudspeakers, so you will not be able to see the Downfill,
Under Balcony and Stage Lip Loudspeakers in the Movie. If you want to see them,
you’ll need to make a new Trace File with all the Loudspeakers turned On. Note
that the opening <i>View Trace File</i> window allows you to select what
Loudspeakers will be used in the Movie. You probably will also want to increase
the number of rays. Using more rays per loudspeaker enhances the Movie display.</p>
<p>The
Movie graphic shown on the next page was made with 1000 rays per loudspeaker
and just the Main loudspeaker and the delayed loudspeakesr in the lip of the
stage turned On.</p>
<p>Note
how the movie shows the delay as the sound expands into the room.</p>

<p><b>Room
Mapping</b></p>
<p>So far
in this Tutorial section we have used only Area Mapping. Room Mapping is
similar to Area Mapping, except that it also allows Map-ping on the Room
surfaces. The setup routine is identical except that you now have a choice of
Mapping on just the Audience Area(s) or the Room surfaces (Faces) or on both.</p>
<p>Note
that in Room Mapping EASE JR users can map only Direct SPL. EASE users have the
option of mapping other measures on the Au-dience Areas and Room Surfaces
(Faces). If you skipped the Overview section of the Tutorial, please return to
pages 35-39 for a more de-tailed description of the two mapping methods.</p>
<p>Room
Mapping is accessed by selecting <i>Room Mapping</i> under the <i>Calculations</i>
pull down menu and following the same steps you followed in Area Mapping.. The
graphic below shows a Direct SPL Map on the Audience Areas as it appears in
Room Mapping.</p>
<p>Note
that the graphic lists the Parameters used in the simulation in the upper left
corner of the map. In our example, it shows that only the Main loudspeaker was
used in the simulations. The other loudspeakers were all turned Off.</p>

<p>The
following graphic shows the Direct SPL mapped on all the room surfaces (Faces)
with only the Main loudspeaker turned On and the Audience Areas turned Off.</p>
<p><img
width=490 height=288 src="E3.files/image093.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice
the black area behind the front Face of the balcony. It shows that this area is
being shadowed by the balcony Face. This didn’t show in Area Mapping since the
Audience Area is at ear height and is not being shadowed by the balcony Face.</p>
<p>The
same holds true for the very rear of the Main floor, only in reverse. In Area
Mapping someone seated in the rear seats of the main foor</p>
<p>Audiences
Areas was shadowed from the Main Loudspeaker by the balcony. However, the floor
under them is not in the shadowed area.</p>
<p>EASE is
very precise.</p>
<p>The
black areas in the back stage area are an indication that EASE had difficulty
calculating a level because of the resolution used in the simulation. Change to
a higher resolution and they will disappear.</p>
<p>You may
wonder why the backstage Faces show an SPL level even though they do not have a
“line of sight” view of the main Loud-speaker. How can they receive Direct
Sound? Remember, we defined Direct Sound to include early reflections that
arrive within 35 ms (a 35 ms Split Time). You are looking at the levels of the
early reflections.</p>
