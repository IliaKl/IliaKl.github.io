<p>The
AURA, Analysis Utility for Room Acoustics, module is an extremely powerful
acoustical analysis tool.</p>
<p>Based
on the CAESAR algorithms developed by Aachen University (RWTH), AURA allows the
calculation of all key room acoustical pa-rameters defined in ISO3382, the
International Standard on Room Acoustic Measurements. These include</p>
<p>Early
Decay Time (EDT)</p>
<p>Reverberation
Time (T10, T20, T30)</p>
<p>Lateral

<p>AURA is
a tool for producing more accurate and realistic acoustical simulations. AURA
initially creates an Echogram (Reflectogram) and then extracts from the Echogram
most of the measures simulated in Standard Mapping, plus a number of
standardized acoustical meas-ures that give the user a more detailed picture of
the room's acoustics and performance.</p>
<p>Whenever
an adequate number of reflections are simulated, an AURA simulation is more
accurate than one created solely from statistical mapping, which estimates the
diffuse field from reverberation time values calculated using generalized
formulas. Statistical mapping, how-ever, requires less time and computer
horsepower to produce its simulations.</p>
<p>We will
use a new model for our AURA exercises. You will find the room in the Examples
folder under EASE40 Data. It's identified as AURA1.</p>

<p><b>Chapter
11: AURA</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>AURA
provides two simulation methods, AURA Mapping and AURA Response:</p>
<p><b>AURA Mapping </b>will map the acoustical
measures (according to ISO standard 3382) on Audience Areas or at individual Listener<b>
</b>Seats by developing an Echogram. AURA Mapping results are adequate for
mapping purposes but not for Auralization.</p>
<p><b>AURA
Response</b>, on the other hand, calculates a Reflectogram, from which a
Binaural Impulse Response can be extracted and<b> </b>used for Auralization.</p>
<p>Before
we start exploring Aura’s capabilities, let’s take a look at the room using
Area Mapping to get a feel for its performance.</p>
<p>Select <i>Area Mapping</i> from the <i>Calculations</i> pull
down menu. The first thing you will notice is that the Main floor Audience Area
is obscuring the Balcony Audience Area. The designer forgot to move one of the
audience areas so this wouldn't happen. No problem, return to the Edit Project
module and select <i>Area Layout</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu. Then
select <i>Move</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu and grab the Main Floor
Audience Area and move it out of the way.</p>
<p>Now
click on the <i>Direct SPL</i> icon. Select all five loudspeakers and both
Audience Areas in the Settings setup screen Also check <i>All Map-pings,then
click </i>on<i> Nex</i>t. When the Items and Noise screens open, accept the
default settings by pressing on<i> Nex</i>t. In the Calculation win-dow make
sure that <i>Map with Shadows</i> is turned On and then press <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Return
to the Area Mapping screen and rerun the Direct SPL simulation. As you can see
from the 1000 Hz to 4000 Hz plot shown below the loudspeaker system is
producing fairly smooth, high level direct sound coverage except in the corners
of the audience areas.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, run an STI simulation. As you can see the intelligibility
looks pretty good.</p>
<p><img width=532 height=305
src="E4.files/image002.jpg"></p>
<p>This would also be a good time to look at the room’s RT60.
Return to the Main menu and from the <i>View</i> pull down menu select <i>Room</i>
<i>Info/Draw RT.</i></p>

<p><b>AURA Mapping</b></p>
<p><img width=266 height=269
src="E4.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, it's time to begin to explore AURA Mapping. Return to the
Area Mapping window and select <i>Aura</i> from the <i>Mapping</i> pull down
menu. This will open the Aura Mapping Settings dialog window.</p>
<p>As you can see it is almost identical to one we have been using
in Standard Mapping. The big difference is that only All Mapping is allowed.
Make sure all five loudspeakers are selected. Next, change the default label
(Calculation #1) to a more meaningful name, such as AuraCalc #1. Then click on <i>Next</i>.</p>
<p>When the Items tab opens notice that you have a choice of
carrying out your analysis on Audience Areas, at specific Listener Seats or
both. You can also choose which Audience Areas and Listener Seats are to be
included. (Note that if we had entered the AURA module through Room Mapping, we
would also be able to include Faces in the investigation.)</p>
<p>The calculation time associated with mapping on Audience Areas
in AURA needs to be carefully assessed. In AURA, Audience Areas are divided
into a grid of points and AURA will develop an Echogram/Reflectogram at each
point. The density of this grid is determined by the Resolution setting in the
previous Tab. If we had planned to use Area Mapping in this exercise, we would
probably have increased the Patch Size under Settings to at least 4, which is a
very low resolution setting when compared to the Patch Size we have been using
in Standard Mapping</p>
<p><img width=265 height=266
src="E4.files/image005.jpg"></p>
<p>Calculation time is also dependent, among other many factors, on
the number of particles (rays) that are used.. The denser the grid and the
higher the num-ber of particles, the more accurate the simulation and the
longer the calcula-tion will take. In many cases, however, the calculation time
would be very long, even with a powerful computing machine. This often prompts
a compro-mise between the different parameters. When compromising, be careful
not to set the Resolution setting too coarse as the maps can then be
misleading.</p>
<p>Another possibility is running the AURA calculations at individual
Listener Seats. The Echogram/Reflectogram is then created only at these points
and the Resolution settings are immaterial. The number of Listener Seats and
their locations can usually be set to yield adequate results in a reasonable
calculation time. By properly placing Listener Seats at representative
loca-tions in the room and then running AURA calculation at these
representative locations you can get descriptive results about the general
performance of the room relatively quickly.</p>
<p><img width=266 height=269
src="E4.files/image006.jpg"></p>
<p>How dense and how far apart these Listener Seats should be
placed is an issue, especially in large rooms where impulse response may change
drasti-cally from one location to another. In these cases a few Listener Seats
may not be enough to draw a descriptive picture of the room's performance and
more Listener Seats will have to be added.</p>
<p>We'll use only the Listener Seats in our exercise. Make sure
that only <i>On</i> <i>Seats </i>is checked and then select all four<i> Listener
Seats </i>under the<i> List. Seat </i>button.</p>
<p>Press <i>Nex</i>t to move onto the Noise tab and then <i>Next</i>
again to open the Cal-culations tab.</p>

<p><b>Calculation Setup Parameters</b></p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image007.jpg"></p>
<p>The Calculations dialog window allows you to choose the number
of <i>Particle</i>s (Rays) that will be used in the simulation, the <i>Length</i>
of the simulation (the width of the Time window), the <i>Default Value</i> for
the Scattering factor that will be taken into account and the <i>Number of
Calculation Threads</i>.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image008.jpg"></p>
<p>The higher the number of Particles (used here as another
ex-pression for radiated rays), the denser the Echogram and the greater the
accuracy. A drop down selection wizard provides several presets that allow you
to choose between fast and rough calculations (<i>Very Low, Low Resolution</i>
settings) and slow and accurate calculations (<i>High, Very High Resolution</i>
settings). Normally, one would start the process by calculat-ing at a lower
resolution to obtain an overview and use higher resolutions once final results
are needed.</p>
<p>You may enter arbitrary particle numbers by selecting the
User-Defined list item. Notice that as you choose one of the resolution levels,
the number of Particles shown in the asso-ciated field changes.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image009.jpg"></p>
<p>A similar drop down menu assists in choosing an appropriate
length for the simulation. The minimum <i>Length [ms</i>] should be
approximately two thirds of the expected RT time. This is the default, labeled <i>Standard,
Fast</i>. The setting <i>Long</i> can be used to enhance the simulation
accuracy, for example in the case of flutter echoes, but it is seldom required.
The setting <i>Extended </i>should only be used if a significant deviation from<i>
</i>the statistical RT is to be expected, such as in coupled rooms.</p>
<p>Using the <i>User-Defined</i> setting you may enter your own
choice, for example for early-energy investigations only sev-eral hundred milliseconds
maybe enough. However, be aware that most room-acoustic measures require a
full-length impulse response</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>Chapter 11: AURA</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>One of AURA's features is its ability to include scattering
(diffusion) in its simulations. Surfaces exposed to sound waves exhibit, in
addition to the specular reflection of the sound waves in a certain direction,
some de-gree of <i>diffusion</i>, which is the scattering of the incident sound
wave in many different directions with considerably attenuated amplitudes. The <i>Scattering
</i>characteristics of Wall Materials, when known, can be entered<i> </i>into
the Wall Materials data base and used in AURA simulations. More details on this
feature follow near the end of this Tutorial section.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image010.jpg"></p>
<p>AURA also provides an <i>Add Scattering</i> feature that factors
a nominal amount of Diffusion into the simulations when the Diffusion
characteris-tics of the wall materials are not known. The <i>Default Value for
Surfaces</i> <i>without Scattering Data </i>defines how wall materials are
treated which<i> </i>have no scattering properties assigned.</p>
<p>Generally, a broadband scattering factor of 20% has turned out
to be a feasible choice for most projects. If your room has very large, smooth
walls you may want to switch to the setting <i>Smooth Flat Surfaces</i> with a
default scattering coefficient of 10%. If your room is very diverse and
in-cludes a lot of columns, diffusers, furniture or other elements you may want
to use <i>Considerable Surface Structures</i> which defines 40% of the
reflected energy as being scattered instead of specularly reflected.</p>
<p>If you want to be more accurate than that, you will need to
define scat-tering coefficients for each of the wall materials in use. We’ll go
into more detail on this later in the Tutorial. Note that if the Scattering
Coeffi-cients of all the wall materials being used have been defined, the
Scat-tering menu will be inoperative. EASE defines &quot;having Scattering
defined&quot; as having at least one 1/3 octave band defined.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image011.jpg"></p>
<p>Introduced with EASE 4.3, the new version 3.0 of AURA features
multi-threaded calculations. This new function allows AURA calculations to be
performed in a fraction of the computation time required previously. It is
particularly efficient on computers having quad-core or larger proces-sors. For
any multi-core computer AURA may be faster by the number of cores compared to
the single-core computer. Additional improvements in AURA compared to the previous
versions further increase the speed gain even on a single-core computer.</p>
<p>To obtain the maximum performance choose the <i>Number of
Calculation</i> <i>Threads </i>equivalent to the number of processors (or
virtual processors)<i> </i>of your computer. Selecting a higher number will
result in too much switching overhead and does not increase the overall
performance. Se-lecting a lower number will keep your computer more responsive
to user input, for example, to work on another project or document while the
computation is running, but it will also slow down the calculation.</p>
<p>For this exercise we suggest using the number of threads equal
to the</p>
<p>number of processors in your computer. This will require almost
all of the</p>
<p>computer’s performance for the calculation, but will be the fastest.</p>

<p>The <i>Advanced Options &gt;&gt;</i> selection bar in the lower
right corner of the Calcula-tions window leads to a new dialog window.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image012.jpg"></p>
<p>AURA Mapping provides two methods of simulating the sound
propagation, <i>En-ergy Loss </i>and<i> Particle </i>Loss. In<i> Energy Loss</i>,
which is the default, the energy at<i> </i>every wall reflection is decreased
by (1-&#945;). In <i>Particle Loss</i> the energy at every wall reflection
remains constant, but a comparison between a random number (range from 0 to 1)
with the absorption coefficient &#945; of the wall will decide whether the ray
will be further traced or not. Energy Loss is more accurate un-less a high
number of Particles are used, but more time-consuming.</p>
<p>AURA also includes a <i>Diffuse Rain</i> option that recognizes
the scattered portion of the simulation more than the conventional method. It's
use is recommended in highly reverberant rooms (such as gyms) and rooms with
partially shadowed areas (such as theaters with deep under-balcony areas) and
side rooms (al-coves). In these cases, it requires smaller Particle numbers and
lower calcula-tion times than the conventional method. For example, 1/10 the
number of Particles is commonly used with Diffuse Rain.</p>
<p>The algorithms that support Diffuse Rain actually generate new
Rays whenever a Ray strikes a surface and follows these new Rays until they
impact upon a Listeners Seat. The energy level of the new Rays takes into
account the Surface's scattering coefficient as well as the surface's
absorption. The energy level of the primary specular reflected Ray is, of
course, reduced by the energy absorbed by the surface and the amount lost
through scattering.</p>
<p>Also available is the setting for <i>Orientation Point</i> which
is required for the correct use of LF and LFC investigations. This is the point
where the imagined receiving head is aimed at, since the two measures LF and
LFC depend on the direction of the intruding sound waves and thus on the
orientation of the receiver. It should normally be set to the coordinates of
the main loudspeaker or to a center point on the stage.</p>
<p>We won’t use <i>Particle Loss</i> or <i>Diffuse Rain</i> in this
simulation. Instead we'll use the default settings; <i>Low Resolution, Fast</i>
for the <i>Particles</i> setting and <i>Standard, Fast</i> for the <i>Length.</i>
figure. Please note, however, that 32,000 Particles is a relatively low figure.
As a result, the re-sults shown in our review may differ slightly from the ones
you get as you work through this exercise. If we used a higher number of
Parti-cles in these simulations, the variations would become smaller.</p>
<p>To start the simulation, press <i>OK</i>. You will then receive
an alert,telling you the amount of RAM and hard disk space needed to complete
the calculation. It gives you the opportunity to modify the setup parame-ters,
if the amount of memory needed is beyond your machine’s capa-bility.</p>
<p><img width=593 height=337
src="E4.files/image013.jpg"></p>
<p>Press <i>OK</i> and AURA will start the calculations, which will
take some time. How long depends on the setup parameters and your computing
machine's capability. A Busy status screen will let you know approxi-mately how
long the simulation will take and follow the progress.</p>

<p>A <i>Combine Loudspeakers</i> prompt will appear as soon as the
calculation is completed.</p>
<p><img width=314 height=340
src="E4.files/image014.jpg"></p>
<p>Clicking on <i>OK</i> will give you access to the Aura Map-ping
Calculation control window . Note that all 5 Loud-speakers are checked.</p>
<p>We used all 5 loudspeakers in our simulation and we certainly
want to save the results, so we don't have to rerun the simulation. To do this,
press <i>Combine Loud-speakers</i>. This will bring up a<i> Save Mapping File </i>prompt.
Let's call the file <i>All Loudspeakers On</i> since it covers the &quot;all
loudspeakers on&quot; simulation. Insert <i>All</i> <i>Loudspeakers On </i>into
the File Name window and<i> </i>press <i>OK</i> to save the mapping file as an
.emp file.</p>
<p>AURA will save the file and then return to the combina-tion
control window to allow you to create and save other Mapping files based on
other Loudspeaker com-</p>
<p>binations. <b>Do not press Done at this time unless</b> <b>you
want to lose all the data in memory.</b></p>
<p>Uncheck Loudspeakers S3, S4 and S5 and then press <i>Combine
Loudspeakers </i>again. Once again you will be<i> </i>prompted to save the
results in a Mapping file, which this time we will call <i>s1s2.emp</i>. Note
that this file will contain the Echogram data for the room with only
Loudspeakers S1 and S2 turned on.</p>
<p><img width=314 height=106
src="E4.files/image015.jpg"></p>
<p>However, the data for all 5 Loudspeakers still exists and will
until you close the Recombination window. This allows you to make more Mapping
Files with other Loudspeaker combinations. After you have fin-ished making
these Files, press the <i>Done</i> button to close the Combination Control
window and start an-alyzing the Mapping files you have created.</p>
<p><img width=404 height=280
src="E4.files/image016.jpg"></p>
<p>AURA will then give you one last reminder that you are going to
lose the chance of any further Recombi-nations if you continue.</p>
<p>Pressing <i>Yes</i> will close the Recombination window and open
a View Calculations window based on the last Loudspeaker Recombination created.</p>
<p>We do not want that Mapping file at this point; we want the <i>All
Loudspeakers On</i> file. To change the file, click on the <i>File Folde</i>r
icon to open the <i>Load</i> <i>Map File </i>dialog box and select the All

<p>The AURA View Calculations window is identical to the View
Calculations window we explored under Room Investigations, only now you will
find that the Echogram Tab is active. Refer to the graphic at the top of the
next page.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=358

<p>If you previously skipped the Room In-vestigations portion of
the Tutorial, we suggest at least scanning it before you go on.</p>
<p><b>Echograms</b></p>
<p>An Echogram differs from a Reflectogram in that an Echogram
stores all the energy arriving at a location in 1 ms wide boxes or bins as they
are commonly called (refer to the graphic shown below).</p>
<p>A Reflectogram records impacts (single</p>
<p>reflections) on a specific location and</p>
<p>stores them. The detailed information</p>
<p>provided by a Reflectogram requires sig-</p>
<p>nificantly more memory but it is also more</p>
<p>accurate and required for good auralizations.</p>
<p><img width=596 height=185
src="E4.files/image018.jpg"></p>
<p>Selecting the <i>Echogram</i> Tab will open the Echogram shown
at the top of the next page. Notice that we have selected Listener Seat #1 for
use in the following graphics and no weighting. Feel free to investigate the
performance at other Listen Seats and/or with A weighting as we go through this
exercise.</p>
<p>Note that the Red Sum and Blue Schroeder curves will not be
visible until you have turned them on. The Sum curve represents the energy
buildup at the chosen location, Listener Seat 1, as a function of time, while
the Schroeder curve is a backward-integration curve. It is used for calculating
the reverberation time</p>
<p>You can manipulate the <i>Time</i> and <i>Scale</i> axes to zoom
in and out on the Echogram. The <i>Step</i> option also allows you to increase
the box size from 1 ms to wider values to show energy summation in case of
identical reflection impacts. This is especially useful with calculations based
on Particle Loss. Try different input values under <i>Scale</i> and <i>Time
[ms]</i> and see for yourself what happens.</p>
<p>Before we check out the wide assortment of acoustical measures
offered by AURA Mapping, lets pause a minute to review a few basics. Classic
measures, such as RT60, D/R Ratio and Critical Distance, are useful indicators
of the acoustic performance of the Room and its sound system, but do not fully take
into account the subjective aspects of the listening experience.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>Chapter 11: AURA</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Over the years, acousticians have developed other measures that
more fully reflect the listener’s tonal perception of sound. ISO 3382, the
International Standard on Room Acoustic Measurements, defines these measures.</p>
<p>A detailed description of these measures is beyond the scope of
this Tutorial. For additional information, we can only refer you to the Ap-pendix
section of the EASE43Manual included in your EASE program and to acoustical
text books. Glenn Ballou's Handbook For Sound Engineers, Fourth Edition, for
example, contains an excellent review of this subject.. You'll find the EASE43
Manual stored under Program Files/EASE 4.3/Easepath/Ease43Manual..</p>
<p><img width=391 height=307
src="E4.files/image019.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, let’s return to the <i>Frequency</i> tab, and check what
acoustical measures AURA Mapping offers. We'll start with <i>EDT</i>. Go to the
drop down Measures selection box in the Tool Bars and select EDT.</p>
<p><b>EDT Early Decay Time</b></p>
<p>EDT stands for <i>Early Decay Tim</i>e, an important room
acoustical version of the RT. Instead of “measuring” the time needed for a 60
dB decay, <i>Early Decay Time</i> meas-ures the time needed for the first 10 dB
drop of the Schroeder decay curve (from 0 dB to -10 dB) and then extrapolates
the 60 dB decay time by multiplying by 6. EDT figures are more related to the
subjective RT impres-sion a listener gets in a room.</p>
<p><img width=391 height=313
src="E4.files/image020.jpg"></p>
<p>For example, compare the EDT curve at Listener Seat 1, to the
other Listener Seats. It is easy to do. Go to the Lo-cation section of the
Tools Bars and click on the &lt; and &gt; arrows to move from one Listeners
Seat to another. No-tice how quick and easy it is.</p>
<p>Note how the RT curves vary from one seat to another, especially
from Listener Seat 3 which is located under the balcony.</p>
<p>Also note that they vary considerably from the Room RT60 curve
calculated using the Eyring RT formula.</p>
<p>237</p>

src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=456 height=365
src="E4.files/image021.jpg"></p>
<p><b>T Measures (T10, T20, T30)</b></p>
<p>Because of the differences between the objectively calculated
classical RT60 and subjectively perceived EDT impres-sions, other RT measures
were also in-troduced. For example, <i>T10</i> which is defined as the time
required, after ex-cluding the first 5 dB of decay, for the sound energy to
decay another 10 dB, multiplied by 6 to project the 60 dB decay time.</p>
<p>The T10 RT curve at Listener Seat 1 is shown to the right.. AURA
also calcu-lates T20 and T30 which have defini-tions close to those of EDT and
T10. Try them out. It only takes a few seconds.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=365
src="E4.files/image022.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Definition</b></p>
<p>Now select <i>Definition</i> at <i>Listener Seat 2</i>, to get
the Definition curve show below. <i>Definition </i>is one of a number of different<i>
</i>energy measures used in room acoustics. It defines what percent the energy
in the first 50 ms after the first arrival is of the total energy. For good
intelligibility a considerable part of the total energy (&gt;50%) should arrive
within this first 50 ms period</p>

<p><img width=456 height=365
src="E4.files/image023.jpg"></p>
<p><b>C50</b></p>
<p>The <i>C50</i> curve is shown on the right at <i>Listener Seat 3</i>,
where we can notice<i> </i>positive values at all one-third-octave bands with a
clear rise at the higher fre-quencies. Any value above 0 dB in a room with
normal reverberation repre-sents good intelligibility. In rooms with higher
than normal reverberation, any value above -5 dB is considered good.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=365
src="E4.files/image024.jpg"></p>
<p><b>STI Speech Transmission Index</b></p>
<p>Another frequently used intelligibility measure is the <i>STI
Speech Transmission</i> <i>Index </i>, which is a single number be-tween 0 and

<p><i>STI </i>is calculated from a set of other<i> </i>numbers called MTF
Modulation Trans-fer Function. It takes into account how the transmission from
source to receiver is affected at different frequency bands and how much these
frequency bands contribute to speech intelligibility. If you turn to the STI
display in our example, you will get the curve shown here, which shows an <i>STI</i>
of 0.694 at <i>Listener Seat</i> <i>3.</i></p>

<p>You may also switch to a STIPa or RaSTI setting to compare with
meas-urement results. Check out the effect of changing these setup parameters
on the STI display.</p>
<p>In addition to these settings, corrections for low
signal-to-noise ratio and for masking of frequency bands can be taken into
account. These parameters for the STI are taken into account ac-cording to the
standard IEC 60268-16 (2003).</p>

<p><b>ALcons%</b></p>
<p><b>Articulation Loss of Consonants</b></p>
<p>ALcons, Articulation Loss of Conso-nants, is another way of
measuring in-telligibility. It measures intelligibility by the percentage of
articulation loss of consonants. The <i>Alcons%</i> for the same Listener Seat
are shown to the right.</p>
<p>Note that we added a tabular listing to the screen by selecting
Combined in the lower left corner of the screen. This al-lows us to read the
exact values at dif-ferent frequency bands. In this case we have Alcons of
3.88%, which is consis-tent with what we would expect from the C50 figures.
Note, however, that it is significantly lower than the result we ob-tained when
we mapped Alcons under Area Mapping.</p>

<p><b>C80 Clarity Measure</b></p>
<p>For the assessment of music, AURA provides the well-known C80
Clarity measure, which belongs to the energy ratios set. It is defined as the
ratio in dB of the energy in the first 80 ms after the first sound arrival to
the energy content arriving after the first 80 ms.</p>
<p>It is not always desirable to have C80 values as high as
possible, because the higher the value of C80 the lower the effect of the
diffuse field, whose exis-tence under proper control is needed in many cases of
music reproduction.</p>
<p>The scale for evaluating the C80 pro-jections is in the Room
Investigations section of this tutorial. In our example, the system would
reproduce the per-cussive instruments especially good.</p>

<p><b>Center Time</b></p>
<p><b>Center Time </b>is a reference value for<b> </b>spatial
impression and clarity. It is de-fined as the ratio between the summed products
of the energy components of the arriving reflections and their corre-sponding
delays to the total energy component. The higher the value, the more spatial is
the acoustic impression.</p>

previous page and the Echo Music Echogram shown here.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=361
src="E4.files/image035.jpg"></p>
<p>Except for early reflections, anything above the Red line is
likely to be a prob-lem while anything above the yellow line is marginal. In
our example, the peak be-tween 60 msec and 75 msec doesn't rep-resent a problem
because of the short delay times. In fact, it’s not uncommon as the early
reflections impact upon the tar-get.</p>
<p>Note that you can use the Cursor to de-termine the exact
location of this peak in time. Run the Cursor across the chart and the delay
times and SPL levels will read out in the Cursor section at the bot-tom of the
screen.</p>
<p><b>Histograms</b></p>
<p>AURA also provides a Histogram as a quick way of checking the
validity of the simulation. A Histogram quickly tells you if an appropriate
number of particles were used in the simulation.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=358
src="E4.files/image036.jpg"></p>
<p>Select <i>Histogram</i> by putting a check in the <i>Histogram</i>
radio button. It's located beneath the <i>Echogram</i> radio button.</p>
<p>This will open the Histogram shown here. As you can see, a
Histogram displays the number of impacts stored in each of the 1 ms wide bins.
The impact display should be both dense and constant during the entire time
frame (1000 ms in this exam-ple). An inadequate number of Particles was used if
the display isn't dense or if it thins out toward the end of the time frame.</p>
<p>The number of impacts stored in each bin is also important. A
good rule of thumb to follow is that on the average each bin should have at
least 10 impacts. If the av-</p>
<p>erage falls much below 10, consideration should be given to
rerunning the calculation with more Particles. If it's below 5, the calculation
should definitely be rerun. You can get a good feel for the average by running
the Cursor across the chart while observing the count in the Cursor readout at
the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Note that when the Particle Loss method is used, some thinning
toward the end of time frame is acceptable as long as only energy ratio
calculations, such as C Measures, will be run. In energy ratio calculations,
only a good impact balance before and after the Split Time needs to be assured.
RT and STI calculations, on the other hand, need a long smooth particle
distribution over time to be accurate.</p>

<p><b>Particle Loss Method</b></p>
<p>We used an <i>Energy Loss</i> simulation in all of our previous
AURA examples. Now let's take a quick look at the faster <i>Particle Loss </i>method.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=358
src="E4.files/image037.jpg"></p>
<p>Return to the <i>Area Mapping</i> window and select <i>Aura</i>
from the <i>Mapping</i> pull down menu. Use all of the same set-tings, except
under the <i>Calculations</i> <i>Tab/Advanced Options </i>switch to<i>
Parti-cle Loss.</i></p>
<p>The first thing you will notice is that the simulation takes far
less time. On our 2.8GHz dual-core machine with 1 MB of RAM less than 30
seconds com-pared to almost 5 minutes for the En-ergy Loss simulation.</p>
<p>The trade off is accuracy. Follow the prompts, do the
Recombination and save the Mapping File. Open the <i>View</i> <i>Calculations </i>window
and click on the<i> Echogram </i>Tab. As can see from the<i> </i>graphic to the
right, the density is far less than it was in the Energy Loss Echogram.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=358
src="E4.files/image038.jpg"></p>
<p>The next logical step is to use the His-togram to see if it
shows a usable simulation. As you can see from the graphic, it doesn't come
close to meet-ing the criteria for a good simulation.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>Chapter 11: AURA</b></p>

src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=456 height=358
src="E4.files/image039.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, do a new study using <i>High Reso-lution Slow</i>, that is,
506,000 Particles. It<i> </i>will take longer, but still less than it took for
the Energy Loss simulation. The re-sulting Echogram appears to the right.</p>
<p>As you can see, the density has in-creased and is now more
comparable to the one generated by the Energy Loss method. You'll also find
that the other simulations are closer to ones generated from the Energy Loss
simu-lation, but that there still are small dif-ferences.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=358
src="E4.files/image040.jpg"></p>
<p>The Histogram shows you why. You still need to use more
Particles to achieve the same degree of accuracy as the Energy Loss method.</p>

<p><b>Aura-Response</b></p>
<p>AURA Response is used mainly for architectural acoustic
investigations and auralization. Its advanced algorithms allow the creation of
Re-flectograms with larger reflection orders and longer time windows than is
possible with the Mirror Image and Ray Tracing algorithms used by EASE. This
eliminates the need to add a statistical Tail to the Reflectogram and improves
the realism of any auralization.</p>
<p>We will begin our exercise by accessing <i>Calculate AURA
Response</i> under <i>Tools</i>, in either the <i>Area Mapping</i> or <i>Room
Mapping</i> modules.</p>
<p>Note that you have to Activate one of the Audience Areas and
pick a spot in one of the active Audience Areas before you can open <i>Calculate</i>
<i>AURA Response</i>. Go to the Items pull down menu and choose<i> Select
Active/Audience Areas </i>and make your Audience Area selection. Don't<i> </i>worry
about the location, you will have a chance to change it before running the
calculations. If you select <i>Room Mapping</i> as the entry port, you don't
need to pick a spot.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=339
src="E4.files/image041.jpg"></p>
<p>AURA Response opens with the AURA Response Calculation setup
window shown to the right..</p>
<p>As you can see, this setup window gives us the opportunity to
select the Loudspeakers that will be used in the simulation and the results
(files) destination. If we select <i>Probe</i>, the result (files) will be sent
to the Probe and the Probe will open at the completion of the simulation.
Se-lecting <i>EARS</i> will open the File in EARS for further processing.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Only Save To File</i> will save the results as a
Response File that can then be opened at any time in the Main menu by going to
the <i>Calculations </i>pull down menu and selecting<i> Probe Post Processing</i>.</p>
<p>Note the <i>Create BIR File</i> check box. The program can also
create a .bir (Binaural Impulse Response File) for auralization at the same
time it creates the .rsp Response File. Creating both at the same time will
lengthen the calculation time, but only by a small amount.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=339
src="E4.files/image042.jpg"></p>
<p>To reduce the calculation time, we'll use only Loudspeakers S1
&amp; S2 and send the results to the Probe. Normally, of course, we would be
using all of the Loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Press <i>Nex</i>t and the <i>Location</i>s Tab window shown here
will appear.</p>
<p>This setup window lets you choose what locations will be used in
the simulation. Note that you can select both the <i>Walker</i> location and
any combination of the <i>Listener Seats</i> and the program will generate a
Re-sponse File for each location selected. We'll use just a single Listener
Seat, Seat 1, to reduce the calculation time.</p>
<p>A more common practice would be to include all the Listener
Seats, so the Room's performance could be evaluated at a number of locations.</p>
<p>Pressing <i>Next</i> will open the <i>Calculation</i> Tab window
shown at the top of the next page.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>The <i>Calculation</i> Tab gives you a chance to review and set
a number of essential parameters for the Response File simulation. The basic
parameters are the same as for the AURA Mapping, please refer to the
description above. Under <i>Advanced Options</i> additional largely spe-cific
to the AURA Response calculation settings are available.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=339
src="E4.files/image043.jpg"></p>
<p>In order to understand them better, note that the Response File
Calcu-lation is done in two separate parts (runs). For the early geometric
re-flections having a reflection order up to the cut off order (the first
part), a hybrid Mirror Image method is used. This method uses a ray tracing
algorithm to scan the room for mirror images using a deterministic, non uniform
directional distribution. For the early scattered reflections and the later
reflections (the second part) an energetic ray tracing algorithm with a uniform
density distribution is used. Both parts are finally added to gain the
response.</p>
<p>The essential parameters are:</p>
<p><b>Max. Diameter after 1s [m]:</b></p>
<p>This setting determines the diameter of the counting balloon
after 1 second. It is automatically adjusted when you select the number of <i>Par-ticles
</i>in the<i> Standard Options </i>screen. This particle number is used for<i> </i>both
the first and the second part of the ray tracing. If you want the re-sults for
the early part to be more precise in comparison to the late part, you have to
lower the <i>Max. Diameter</i> setting accordingly.</p>
<p>This parameter can be adjusted according to the room details. In
a room with only a few large walls, a larger value can be chosen. On the other
hand, in a room with many walls which give the room a lot more details, a
smaller number (diameter) is appropriate. A good choice is to use the diameter
of the smallest surface. However, less than 1m (3 Ft.) is usually not really
necessary and more than 5m (15 Ft.) is probably too large.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=339
src="E4.files/image044.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the number of rays is proportional to 1/d <b>2</b>.
In other words doubling the diameter makes this part of the calculation run 4
times faster. For our purpose, the default setting will be sufficient.</p>
<p><b>Cut Off Order:</b></p>
<p><i>Cut Off Order </i>sets the transition reflection
order where the program<i> </i>switches from the hybrid Mirror Image method to
the ray tracing calcu-lation method. No extrapolation is used.</p>
<p>For the second part, the ray tracing calculation, sound
particles are ra-diated with a well defined energy depending on the directivity
of the source. These particles are followed through the room and each time a
reflection takes place at a surface the surface absorption is taken into
account. Finally, if the particle hits a receiver its current energy is added
to a Bin in an Echogram. The Bin is selected according to the source's delay
and the distance travelled by the particle.</p>
<p>The Order should be set depending on the probability of singular
strong or flutter echoes in the room. If all walls are more or less scattering
surfaces, smaller orders can be used. If some walls have a low scattering
coefficient, larger reflection orders should be used</p>
<p>The program will accept settings from 1 to 30 and the default
setting is 10. Usually relatively small Orders (5 to 7) are used for Probe
re-flection studies and higher numbers used if the simulation will be used for
auralization.</p>

part in the reflectogram. Set-tings from 10 to 30 are acceptable and the
default setting is 20. We'll use 10.</p>
<p><b>Tail Resolution:</b></p>
<p><i>Tail Resolution </i>defines the time resolution for
the calculation of the tail<i> </i>part by setting the width of the time boxes
(bins) used for the energy distribution of the late part. A range from 1 to 10
is allowed with a de-fault setting of 5. We'll use 5.</p>
