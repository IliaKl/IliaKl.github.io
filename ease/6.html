<p><b>Chapter 6. Import / Export Capabilities</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The IMEX Import &amp; Export Module included in EASE JR and EASE
allows a wide variety of different file types to be imported into the pro-gram
and most EASE files to be exported in a number of formats.</p>
<p><img width=210 height=237
src="E2.files/image120.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE 2.1, CADP2, ASCII, Google SketchUp and AutoCAD DXF Files
can all be imported, while most EASE 4.3 data files can be exported to other
programs as either Google SketchUp, AutoCAD DXF or ASCII Files, or exported
directly to EASE 3.0. EASE 3.0 Files open automatically in 4.3 and do not need
to be imported.</p>
<p>To open the IMEX Import/Export Module select <i>Import/Expor</i>t
from the <i>File</i> pull down menu in the Main EASE screen. When the IMEX
window opens, open the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu shown here.</p>
<p>Note that if you enter the IMEX module as a “stand alone” module
(without a project loaded) the Export listing will be grayed out.</p>
<p><b>Import EASE 2.1</b></p>
<p>To import existing EASE 2.1 files, select <i>Import EASE 2.1</i>
to open the sub-menu shown here: The first three choices are used to Import old
EASE 2.1 projects into 4.3. The first option, <i>Project / Global Base </i>will
install the EASE 2.1 Loudspeaker and Material database files that<i> </i>are a
part of the EASE 2.1 project file into the EASE40Data Global Speaker and
Material database folders.</p>
<p><img width=204 height=168
src="E2.files/image121.jpg"></p>
<p>The second option, <i>Project / Local Base</i>, will install the
EASE 2.1 Loudspeaker and Material database files along with the project files.
It allows you to keep the old database files separate from the newer database
files.</p>
<p>The third choice, <i>Project Group / Local Base</i> is used to
import a group of 2.1 project files into 4.3. Note that the data files will be
kept separate from the EASE 4.3 database files.</p>
<p>The second set of import choices, <i>Speaker File</i> and <i>Speaker
Folde</i>r, allow existing EASE 2.1 Loudspeaker files to be imported into 4.3.
Speaker File imports a single loudspeaker data file, while Speaker Folder
imports a group of loudspeaker data files. The Speaker File method is
recommended since it provides you with more control over the import routine.
Note that all imported loudspeakers will be marked &quot;Non-Authorized.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Material File </i>and Material<i> Folder </i>perform
the same functions for Wall Materials. In all cases,<i> </i>make your selection
and then follow the Prompts.</p>
<p><b>Export EASE 3.0 Project</b></p>
<p>Export EASE 3.0 Project provides a means of converting and
exporting an EASE 4.3 Project File as an EASE 3.0 Project File. Note that this
option is not available unless a Project has been loaded into the program.</p>
<p>The conversion, however, is not always a perfectly smooth one
and some editing of the 3.0 Project File may have to be done. Also note that
none of the 4.3 Data Files, (Loudspeakers, Wall Materials, etc.) will be
exported. They cannot be converted from 4.3 to 3.0 files. This means the
loudspeaker and materials used in the 4.3 project must exist in the 3.0
Databases as 3.0 files</p>
<p>EASE 4.3 will export the converted Project file as a Packed
(zipped) file. When installing it in 3.0, make sure the Base File Find option
is checked. Then EASE 3.0 will attempt to reassign the 4.3 Wall Material and
Loudspeaker pointers.</p>

<p><b>Import CADP2</b></p>
<p><img width=137 height=107
src="E2.files/image122.jpg"></p>
<p><b>I</b>mport CADP2 is used to import existing CADP2 Job Data into EASE
4.3. Click on<b> </b><i>Import CADP2</i><b> </b>to<b> </b>open the sub-menu
shown here, then select the file type and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>Note that CADP2 Devices and Absorbers should be imported first,
Array Files next and then the Job File.</p>
<p><img width=152 height=213
src="E2.files/image123.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Import ASCII</b></p>
<p>Import ASCII allows &quot;Comma And Quotes-Delimited&quot; ASCII
Files created by spread sheet programs for Speaker Models, Wall Materials,
Lamps and IR Emitters to be imported into the program. Edges, Faces,
Loudspeakers, Audience Areas and Listener Seats ASCII files created by EASE
3.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 can also be imported.</p>
<p>Select <i>Import ASCII</i>, then make your selection from the
sub-menu shown and follow the Prompts.</p>
<p>Note that the file name extension filter is different for each
item. Examples of properly formatted ASCII files can be viewed by using Windows
Explorer to browse to <i>Program Files/EASE 4.3/EasePath/Exam-ples_ASCII.</i></p>
<p><img width=152 height=170
src="E2.files/image124.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Import ASCII (EASE 2.1)</b></p>
<p>ASCII files generated by EASE 2.1 are formatted differently than
the ones created by EASE 3.0 and EASE 4.3. The Import ASCII (EASE 2.1) option
opens the sub-menu shown here to allow these files to be imported into EASE
4.3.</p>
<p><img width=150 height=158
src="E2.files/image125.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Export ASCII</b></p>
<p>Export ASCII allows EASE 4.3 project files to be exported in
ASCII format for use in other programs such as Word or Excel. Note that this
option will not be available unless you have loaded a project into the program.
Then select <i>Export ASCII</i> and make your choice from the sub-menu shown
below.</p>
<p><b>Import DXF / SKP</b></p>
<p>Import DXF / SKP allows files created by Computer-Aided-Design
(CAD) programs to be imported into the program. See the CAD File Transfer
section that follows for more information.</p>
<p><b>Export DXF</b></p>
<p>Export DXF allows EASE 4.3 project files to be exported in DXF
format for use in AutoCAD. Note that this option will not be available un-less
you have loaded a project into the program. See the CAD File Transfer section
that follows for more information.</p>
<p><b>Export SKP</b></p>
<p>Export SKP allows EASE 4.3 project files to be exported to
Google SketchUp. Note that this option will not be available unless you have
loaded a project into the program. See the CAD File Transfer section that
follows for more information.</p>

<p><b>Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) File Transfer</b></p>
<p>Both EASE and EASE JR have facilities to Import and Export both
DXF and SketchUp files. This means that drawing files can be ex-changed between
EASE/EASE JR and any 3D CAD program that can work with DXF or SketchUp files.</p>
<p>For the following exercises we will assume you will be
exchanging files with AutoCAD 2010 or Google SketchUp 7. It's possible to use
other 3D CAD programs or older versions of AutoCAD or SketchUp in a similar
manner; however there may be differences in procedure. EASE exports files that
are compatible with Google SketchUp 6 and AutoCAD 2000 DXF. Review the
operations manual for your CAD pro-gram if you have any doubts.</p>
<p>The Export process is relatively simple. The first step is to
open the project you want to export. We'll use Theater 1 for this exercise.
There are two ways to do this, using the Main menu or by opening the EASE IMEX
module as a stand-alone module.</p>
<p>If you choose the Main menu method, select <i>Import/Export</i>
from the Main menu bar's <i>File</i> pull down menu after loading the project.
This will open the EASE IMEX Import/Export program module with a blank screen.
Then follow the instructions for exporting DXF or SXP files that follow.</p>
<p>If you choose to run the EASE IMEX module as a stand-alone
module, select <i>Close Project</i> from the <i>Main</i> menu's <i>File</i>
pull down menu, then select <i>Import/Export</i> from the Main menu's <i>File</i>
pull down menu. When the IMEX module opens, select <i>Open Project</i> from the
<i>File</i> pull down menu and browse to <i>Theater 1</i>. Click <i>OK</i>.
Then follow the instructions for exporting DXF or SXP files that follow.</p>
<p><b>Exporting DXF Files from EASE</b></p>
<p>Select <i>Export DXF</i> from the Tools pull down menu. This
will open a window asking you for the name of the file you are creating and
where you want it saved. Enter the requested information and then press <i>Save</i>
to open the Export DXF screen shown below.</p>
<p><img width=336 height=260
src="E2.files/image126.jpg"></p>
<p>The DXF Length Unit section provides a means of rescaling the
model before exporting it. EASE works in Meters (internally it converts Meters
to Inches for non Metric users) and you may want to rescale the drawing before
exporting it. For example, if you are exporting the drawing for use by an
Architect, you may want to rescale the drawing to Inches. Most architects work
in Architectural units (inches con-verted to feet and inches for display
purpose).</p>
<p>The EASE -&gt; DXF section provides two options for the export
of the Face coordinates. Selecting <i>Convert EASE Faces to: 3D PolyFaces</i>
will create entities that can be shaded and rendered in AutoCAD. Because the
faces of the mesh are planar, the mesh will approximate curved surfaces in the
same way that EASE does and will maintain the structure of the EASE Faces and
the exact Vertex coordinates.</p>
<p><i>Convert EASE Faces to: 3D Polyline</i>s will
create entities that will not be rendered in AutoCAD. This option is the best
choice for programs<i> </i>that do not support 3d PolyFaces and will maintain
the structure of the EASE Faces and the exact Vertex coordinates. Press <i>OK</i>
to close the window and export the DXF File.</p>

<p><b>Importing EASE DXF Files into AutoCAD</b></p>
<p>Open AutoCAD and select <i>Open</i> from the <i>File</i> pull
down menu. Select the <i>Files of Type:</i> drop down menu and change it from
Drawing</p>
<p>(*.dwg) to <i>DXF (*.dxf)</i>. Then Browse to the DXF file you
created for this exercise and press <i>Open</i>. That's all there is to it. The
model is now in AutoCAD as a drawing and can be manipulated in AutoCAD just
like any other AutoCAD drawing.</p>
<p>Select <i>SE Isometric</i> from the sub-menu <i>3D Views</i> in
the <i>View</i> pull down menu to display the drawing similar to the default 3D
view in EASE. Note that all the elements of the EASE model were exported.</p>
<p><img width=441 height=359
src="E2.files/image127.jpg"></p>
<p>The Export/Import routine placed the various EASE drawing items
and materials on different Layers in the AutoCAD drawing and assigned names and
colors to the Layers that correspond to their EASE Wall Material names and
colors. For details, go to the AutoCAD Format pull down menu and select Layers.
This will open the AutoCAD Layer dialog shown below.</p>

<p><b>Exporting SKP Files from EASE</b></p>
<p>Select <i>Export SKP</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu.
This will open a window asking you for the name of the file you are creating
and where you want it saved. Enter the requested information and then press <i>Save</i>
to open the Export SKP screen shown here.</p>
<p><img width=174 height=168
src="E2.files/image129.jpg"></p>
<p>The EASE -&gt; SKP section provides two options for the quality
of the drawing export. Selecting <i>Quality of Drawing: Draft (fast) </i>is the
quickest way to create a SketchUp drawing and can be used<i> </i>if there are
no or only a few EASE Faces that are not exactly planar. This is the Default
setting.</p>
<p><i>Quality of Drawing: Good (slow) </i>will
create a SketchUp drawing that groups all non-planar EASE<i> </i>Faces to
create a higher quality rendering in SketchUp. This can take a long time to
convert if there are many non-planer EASE Faces. Use this setting if the Draft
setting has too many extra lines on the surfaces.</p>
<p><b>Importing EASE SKP Files into SketchUp</b></p>
<p>Open Google SketchUp and select <i>Open</i> from the <i>File</i>
pull down menu. Then Browse to the SKP file you created for this exercise and
press <i>Open</i>. That's all there is to it. The model is now in SketchUp as a
drawing and can be manipulated in SketchUp just like any other SketchUp
drawing.</p>
<p>Select <i>Iso</i> from the sub-menu <i>Standard Views</i> in the
<i>Camera</i> pull down menu and then press <i>Ctrl-Shift-E</i> to display the
drawing similar to the default 3D view in EASE. Note that all the elements of
the EASE model were exported.</p>
<p><img width=528 height=436
src="E2.files/image130.jpg"></p>
<p>The Export/Import routine placed the various EASE drawing items
and materials on different Layers in the SketchUp drawing and assigned names
and colors to the Layers that correspond to their EASE Wall Material names and
colors. For details, go to the SketchUp Window pull down menu and select <i>Layers</i>.
This will open the SketchUp Layer dialog shown on the next page.</p>

<p><b>Importing AutoCAD® DXF Files into EASE</b></p>
<p>Importing AutoCAD 3D DXF drawing files into EASE is just as
simple as exporting an EASE model to AutoCAD as a DXF file -- <b>when the</b> <b>AutoCAD
drawing has been properly formatted.</b></p>
<p>Unlike EASE 3.0 which could import only DXF drawing files
created with 3D Faces, EASE 4.3 can import most AutoCAD drawing ele-ments. The
main exceptions are Solids and Regions. Fortunately, they can easily be
converted to elements that can be read by EASE using the XEDGES command in
AutoCAD 2007 and later. In fact, if you have AutoCAD and want to model the room
in AutoCAD and then Export it to EASE, you may want to construct the AutoCAD
model using 3D Solids and then use the XEDGES command before exporting it to a
DXF file that EASE can use.</p>
<p><b>At this point, you may want to take a few minutes to review the
Import-Export-DXF section of the EASE Manual. It contains some very useful
hints. You'll find the DXF section in Chapter 13.</b></p>
<p><b>The EASE Manual is stored as a PDF File under C:/<i>ProgramFiles/EASE4.3/EasePath/EASE43
Manual.</i> Additional information on Importing DXF files can also be found on
the web at <i>olsonsound.com/ease/index.html.</i></b></p>
<p>If you do not have AutoCAD and are working with an Architect who
does, be sure to tell him of the limitations of the Import routine. In fact,
you may want to copy this portion of the Tutorial and the DXF section of the
EASE 4.3 Manual and give it to him as a guide.</p>
<p>Note: EASE like other similar programs cannot convert 2D
drawings into a 3D model. However, 2D drawings exported as DXF files can be
imported into EASE. Some users will import the room's 2D floor plan drawing
into EASE and then use it as the foundation for their 3D EASE model.</p>
<p>To import a file, return to the EASE IMEX Import/Export program
module (select <i>Import/Export</i> from the <i>Main</i> menu bar's <i>File</i>
pull down menu) and select <i>Import DXF/ SKP</i> from the <i>Tool</i>s pull
down menu. This will open a window asking for the name and location of the file
you want to Import.</p>
<p>We might as well use the Theater 1 DXF File we created under
Export DXF. Browse to it and press <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>This will bring up the Import DXF Setup screen shown on the next
page.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=673 height=398
src="E2.files/image132.jpg"></p>
<p>We will start by setting the <i>Vertex Snap Cube</i> to 0. This
will bring in all the Vertex coordinates without altering their location. This
is a good way to start, especially if you are importing an unknown model.</p>
<p>We'll accept the default settings for <i>Plane Face Tolerance</i>,
<i>Min. Circle Sectors</i> and <i>Max. Arc-Sector Length</i>. We may want to
change these later after we have had a look at the imported model. The <i>Min.
Circle Segments</i> setting of 8, for example, is fine for importing small
circles but may be too low for any large circles. We won't know until we have
imported the project and looked at it.</p>
<p>We will also leave all the checkboxes unchecked. This will keep
the import time to a minimum. This is a good practice to follow when you are
importing an unknown file. Your first objective is to open the file to see what
you have.</p>
<p>Press <i>OK</i> to close the window and import the DXF File.</p>
<p>The Assign Wall Material window shown on the next page will
open.</p>
<p>In this case all of the materials were correctly assigned based
on the Layer Names from the imported file.</p>
<p>Select the <i>Assign from List</i> or <i>Assign from File</i>
button when a row is selected to change the Assigned EASE Material for that
Layer in the imported file.</p>
<p>If you intend to import this project multiple times or will be
importing a number of files that use the same set of Wall Materials then you
should press the <i>Save Map</i> button to create a text-formatted map file
that contains a table of layer names and Wall Material files. You can then use
the <i>Load Map</i> button when importing the subsequent files to assign the
materials to the same layers.</p>
<p>Refer to the EASE 4.3 Manual or the Help files for a description
of the rest of the options and buttons in this window.</p>

<p>Select <i>OK</i>
to close the dialog window. A Save File prompt will appear giving you the
opportunity to save the File as an EASE Project File. You can either save it
now or save it later, after you have had a chance to look more closely at the
imported DXF File. We suggest taking a closer look before saving it, but the
choice is yours. <i>Save</i> or <i>Cancel</i> the Save File prompt and the File
will open in the IMEX window shown below.</p>

<p>If you
have AutoCAD and had the opportunity to look at the model in AutoCAD, you will
note that the item colors are the same as the colors were in AutoCAD.</p>
<p>Normally
your first step would be to check the dimensions of the model to see if you
used the right scaling for the Import. You'll find the overall dimensions
listed in the upper left corner of the screen. If they appear to be much too
large or too small, you can either import the file again or open the <i>Edit</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Rescale Project</i> to rescale the model's
dimensions.</p>
<p>Next,
look carefully at the drawing. Does it look like you anticipated or do you
suspect that some details or items are missing? If so, who-ever created the DXF
File in AutoCAD, may have turned one or more Layers Off or Frozen them before
creating the DXF File. Try import-ing the File again, only this time check <i>Read
“off”</i> and <i>“frozen” Layers</i> in the <i>Options</i> section of the
Import DXF window. This will &quot;unfreeze&quot; the Frozen Layers and turn
&quot;On&quot; any that were turned &quot;Off&quot;.</p>
<p>Be aware
that some of the Faces/Edges may be difficult to see on small or low resolution
screens because of the lack of contrast between the material colors and the
background color of the IMEX window.. In most cases, the Faces/Edges are there,
you just can’t see them. To verify that they are there Save the file and open
it in Edit Project.</p>
<p>Now,
it's time to save the file as an EASE Project File if you didn't save it
immediately after importing it. If you didn't save it previously, go to the
File pull down menu and select <i>Apply Project Data</i>. This will close the
IMEX Import/Export program module and allow you to save the project in the EASE
Main window.</p>
<p>Note
that the preceding paragraph assumes you followed the Tutorial closely and had
a project open when you entered the IMEX program module. If you opened the IMEX
program module as a stand-alone module (without having first loaded a project)
the Apply Project Data command line won't be available to you. You have to go
to the <i>File</i> pull down menu and select <i>Save As</i> and then manually
close the IMEX Import/Export program module.</p>
<p>Then
select <i>Open</i> Project from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu in the <i>Main</i>
window, browse to the Project File you created, open the project and go to the <i>Edit
Project Data</i> mode. Note that the Vertices and Faces are all there.</p>
<p><b>Importing
Google SketchUp SKP Files into EASE</b></p>
<p>Importing
Google SketchUp SKP drawing files into EASE is just as simple as exporting an
EASE model to SketchUp as a SKP file when the SketchUp drawing has been
properly formatted.</p>
<p>We
might as well use the Theater 1 SKP File we created under Export SKP. Browse to
it and press OK. This will bring up the Import SKP Setup screen shown below.</p>
<p><img
width=209 height=164 src="E3.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>We will
leave the Include Invisible Structures checkbox unchecked. If there are

<p><b>Some
Hints For Those Who Do Not Have AutoCAD</b></p>
<p>Now,
let's take another look at some of the problems you may encounter when you
Import an unknown file.</p>
<p>Importing
an AutoCAD DXF File of unknown properties when you don't have AutoCAD and can't
look at the drawing or modify it can be a real challenge. Fortunately EASE 4.3
includes a number of tools that can help you.</p>
<p><b>What if
the File doesn't Import? </b>This is a sign that the DXF does not have
any importable elements, or that all layers are frozen or the<b> </b>File
format is wrong. All you can do is to go back to the source of the DXF File and
review with them what you need.</p>
<p><b>What if
you can see a multitude of lines in the drawing, but very few Faces? </b>Try
importing the drawing again, only with the<b> </b><i>Closed</i><b> </b><i>Multiple
Lines to Faces </i>option turned On in the Import DXF Setup window. The import
routine will then create a Face from any set of lines,<i> </i>polylines and
arcs that are planar and when connected end-point to start-point they enclose
an area.</p>
<p><b>What if
the drawing includes a multitude of small Faces? </b>Try the<b>
</b><i>Collect Scattered Faces</i><b> </b>option.<b> </b><i>Collect Scattered
Faces</i><b> </b>will create a<b> </b>single Face from any set of Faces that
are planar and completely fill an area.</p>
<p>When
you select <i>Collect Scattered Faces</i>, two new options will appear, <i>Cut
Intersecting Faces</i> and <i>Overlap Test</i>. <i>Collect Scattered Faces</i>
may produce Faces that intersect (have one Face going through another without
creating an intersection). <i>Cut Intersecting Faces</i> will cut these Faces
into pieces.</p>
<p>Collect
Scattered Faces may also produce Faces that look incomplete. When this happens,
check the <i>Overlap Test</i>. This should solve the problem.</p>
<p><b>What if
Collect Scattered Faces only eliminated a few of the small Faces? </b>Try
rerunning the import routine with a larger<b> </b><i>Plane Face</i><b> </b><i>Tolerance</i>.
This will enable the<i> Collect Scattered Faces </i>option to combine more
Faces.</p>
<p><b>What if
the drawing has a number of Face borders that contain a number of Vertices? </b>Try the<b>
</b><i>Straighten Border of Faces</i><b> </b>option. The<b> </b>import routine
will look for these Vertices and delete any that are on the Face border between
the corner Vertices.</p>
<p><b>What if
the Straighten Border of Face Option only deletes a few of the surplus
Vertices? </b>Try rerunning the import routine with a<b> </b>larger <i>Vertex
Snap Cube</i>.</p>
<p><b>What if
the drawing includes a number of &quot;Outside&quot; Faces? </b>Try the<b>
</b><i>Waste Outside Faces</i><b> </b>option.<b> </b><i>Waste Outside Faces</i><b>
</b>uses a Ray<b> </b>Tracing algorithm to detect inside Faces and mark outside
Faces. Outside Faces are assigned a &quot;Waste&quot; wall material in EASE.
They are then relatively easy to delete using the Project's Face Table.</p>
<p>If
there are a large number of outside Faces and you have AutoCAD, another way to
get rid of them is to Export the project back to Auto-CAD. They will all be
placed on a Waste layer in AutoCAD and can then easily be deleted by deleting
the Layer.</p>
<p>The Ray
Tracing algorithm also detects Two-Fold Faces and corrects the orientation of
Faces that are improperly oriented.</p>
<p>One
word of caution concerning <i>Waste Outside Faces</i>. It uses a so-called
Spy-Point as the source of the Detection Rays. Without Auto-</p>
<p>CAD,
you have no way of knowing where the Spy-Point(s) is (are) located or how many
of them are included. The odds are that the Auto-</p>
<p>CAD
drawing won't have any Spy-Points, but you never know until you have tried it.</p>
<p>If the
AutoCAD drawing doesn't include any Spy-Points, EASE will place a Spy-Point in
the geometric center of the model. Be careful on this one. If you have an L
shaped room or some other strange shape, it's possible the geometric center may
be outside the room.</p>
<p>Selecting
<i>Waste Outside Faces</i> will introduce a sub-menu giving you the opportunity
to set the <i>Detection Order</i> for the Ray Tracing Algo-rithm or to use the <i>Auto</i>
setting. The <i>Auto</i> setting will run the routine until it assumes that all
internal Faces have been found. This can take a long time in models having a
large number of Faces. We suggest starting with a low <i>Detection Order</i>.</p>

<p><b>What if
only one side of the room imports? </b>Return to the Import DXF window
and check<b> </b><i>Add Symmetrical Entities</i><b> </b>in the Options
sec-tion. The Import routine will then put in the other side of the room as a
mirror image.</p>
<p><b>Can I
import just Edges and not Faces? </b>If the model is very complex,
it may be easier to just import the structure of the model without<b> </b>any
of the planar lines being automatically turned into Faces. In the Import DXF
window check the <i>Only Structure (Faces to Edges)</i> in the Options section.
The Import routine will only import the edges of the surfaces as EASE Edges.
You can then use the coordinates of the Edges to draw your own EASE Faces or
Extrude the edges to create Faces. After you are done creating all the Faces
you can delete all the Edges using the Edge Table.</p>
<p>As soon
as you are satisfied that you have a usable drawing, your first step will
probably be to determine if there are any Holes in the Room. The odds are that
there may be a few as some of the Faces may be incorrectly oriented. This
should be easy to correct using the Find Holes/Fix Holes technique we learned
while building Tutorial 1.</p>
<p>If you
did not assign materials to all the layers using the Assign Wall Material
window then the Color and Material Coupled feature of EASE will simplify the
task of assigning materials based on the color of the surface. Open <i>Tables</i>
under the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu and select <i>Faces</i>. This will open
the Edit Face Table. The<i> Color and Material Coupled </i>command is under the<i>
Tools </i>pull down menu. It enables you to<i> </i>change the material of all
Faces having the same color by changing the material on just one of them. It's
a great time saver if the model has a large number of Faces.</p>
<p>If the
AutoCAD drawing didn't include material colors, the simplest thing to do is
select one of the Faces, then right click to open the Mouse Menu (or use the
Ctrl + F3 key command) to open the <i>Change All Same</i> window and insert the
material used on the highest num-ber of Faces. This will take care of all the
Faces that use that material quickly and reduce the number of Faces you have to
do individually.</p>
