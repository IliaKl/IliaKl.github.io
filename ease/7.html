<p><b>Chapter
7:</b> <b>Optimize RT</b></p>
<p>One of
the very powerful analysis tools included in both EASE and EASE JR is Optimize
RT.</p>
<p>Our
Theater 1 model is not ideal for music because of its low reverberation times.
It's a bit dry. Optimize RT is a quick and easy way to in-vestigate what can be
done to correct the room acoustics.</p>
<p>Open
the Theater 1 model, go to the Edit Project Data module and select Optimize RT
from the Tools pull down menu to open the Opti-mize RT window shown below.</p>
<p><img

<p>The top
graph displays the absorption coefficients of the Material shown in the
Material field to the left of the graph; in this case PLAST/LTHS. The figures
below the Material window tell you how much of the room's surface area is
covered by that material; in this case almost 1/3 of the total surface area.</p>
<p>The
down arrow opens a listing of all the materials used in the room. This allows
you to quickly scan through the materials and their ab-sorption coefficients.
The materials are listed in order based on the percentage of surface area they
cover. Note that in this room only 3 materials cover almost 70% of the room's
surface. If we are going to significantly change the RT times we are probably
going to have to deal with one of these materials (surfaces).</p>
<p>Also
note that this module is an excellent spot to quickly review and compare the
absorption characteristics of a number of materials. All you have to do is to
load them into the project and then you can review them much faster than you
can in the Main Material Base module.</p>
<p>The
bottom graph shows the calculated RT times for the room. Don't be alarmed if
the curve looks a little different than the one shown in Room RT under the View
pull down menu. It's the vertical scaling that makes the difference.</p>
<p>The
Tentative section of the Optimize RT screen allows you to
&quot;tentatively&quot; replace one of the materials with a different material
and view the effect. First, choose the material you want to replace in the
Material window. We’ll choose CINDBLK R which covers 24.27% of the room’s
surface area.</p>

<p>Then in
the Tentative section use the drop down arrow to open the list of materials
available in the Pool and choose a new material. Choosing WOOD FLR produces the
results shown below. The green curves show the changes. It looks like we are
headed in the right di-rection.</p>

<p>Selecting
<i>Pick</i> and then clicking on the <i>Wall Material Absorption Coefficients</i>
or the <i>Reverberation Times</i> graphs allows you to change the Absorption
Coefficient or RT Times frequency by frequency. Clicking on <i>Draw</i> lets
you draw a new desired Absorption Coefficient or RT60 curve. To use Pick, click
on a point on the Absorption Coefficient or RT Time curve and then use your
Mouse to move the curve up or down at that frequency. To use Draw, click on a
point and then use your Mouse to &quot;drag&quot; the desired curve across the
graph.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that as you are drawing new curves, if you don't like the one you have drawn
you can erase it by clicking on one of the Set <i>Edit Val-ues </i>buttons.
They act as Reset buttons by restoring the original values.</p>
<p>Also
notice that the program will not let you do the impossible. The absorption of
the PLAST/LTHS surfaces is so small that little can be ac-complished toward
increasing the room's RT60 by substituting a material with a lower absorption
coefficient. So, the program won't let you set an RT60 time curve higher than
the curve you would get if the PLAST/LATHS surfaces were all changed to MIRROR
reflectors having no absorption. It will only let you draw a slightly higher
RT60 time curve. This tells you that if you are going to make the room more
rever-berant, you will have to work on one of the materials covering more
surface area.</p>
<p>At this
point you can either go through the materials (surfaces) one by one until you
find a combination that gives you the desired RT Times or you can enter a
desired RT curve (the Target curve) and use Seek to let the program seek out
from a Pool of surface materials the one which comes closest to producing the
desired result. You can also mark the Target Curve with a Tolerance frame if
you like. Put a check in the Tolerance check box under Target Values and then
press <i>Set Target</i> under <i>Edit Values</i>.</p>
<p>Select <i>Seek</i>
and the program will search the Pool for you and select the best one available
in the Pool. For us, the program's initial selec-tion was WOOD FLR, a material
we weren’t sure we wanted to use for the surfaces involved). So, we redrew the
Target Curve and pressed Seek again to see if the program would come up with
anpother material. See how fast it is to try different solutions.</p>
<p>Note
that at this point the only purpose of Target Values is to visualize the
desired RT and, if wanted a tolerance range. You can also re-turn to Edit
Project and expand the Pool of available Materials. To do this, return to the
Edit Program windowe and go to The Edit pull down menu and select Select
Project DataBase/Select Wall Material to browse through the Material database
and make your selections.</p>
<p><img

<p>At this
point the normal thing to do would be to <i>Apply</i> and <i>OK</i> the change
and return to one of the mapping programs to see what effect this change had on
the overall system.</p>
<p>Note
that we could have also opened the Edit Table Tab and entered the desired
Absorption Coefficients or RT Times in the data spread-sheet under Edit Value.</p>
<p>It also
should be noted that this example is a little unique in that usually we are
looking for a way to decrease the RT Times instead of in-creasing them. The
principle is the same, however.</p>
