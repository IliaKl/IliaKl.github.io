<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Installation and Registration Instructions</b></p>
<p>Before you begin to install EASE 4.3 on your computer, make sure
your computer has sufficient memory and hard disk space.</p>
<p>EASE runs under Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems on
PC's with a VGA graphics system. Windows 95, Windows ME (Millennium), Windows
2000 and Windows NT are not supported. Multi core processors and 64-bit
resolution are supported.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements are a machine with 256 MB or more of RAM,
600 MHz or higher clock speed and at least 2 gigabyte or more of hard disk
space (EASE requires a minimum of 600 MB of hard disk space.) Faster, 800 MHz
or higher clock speeds and larger RAMs are highly recommended for advanced
users. Microsoft .NET Framework v2.0 is also required. Refer to Addendum 1 for
more detailed equip-ment requirements.</p>
<p>Note 1. If you are using a virus protection system, you should
disable it before beginning the installation.</p>
<p>Note 2. If you have EASE 3.0 installed on your machine, you do
not need to uninstall it before installing EASE 4.3. The two programs are
compatible and can run side by side on the same machine. You will be asked by
the 4.3 install program if you want to uninstall EASE 3.0. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>Note 3. If you have EASE 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 installed on your
machine, you do not need to uninstall them before installing 4.3. The 4.3 In-</p>
<p><img width=377 height=91
src="E1.files/image005.jpg"></p>
<p>stall routine will automatically ask if you want to uninstall
the previous version. Answer <i>Yes</i> to both uninstall prompts. You may also
en-counter <i>Shared File Detected</i> and <i>Read Only File Detected</i>
dialog boxes. In both case select <i>Don’t display this message again</i> and
then click on Yes.</p>
<p><b>Important: The default file path structure for earlier versions
of EASE and EASE JR placed the Data and Project files in an EASE40Data
directory on your C: drive. The current MS recommended path structure places
the Data and Project files in C:\Documents and Settings\All
Users\Documents\EASE40Data in systems running under XP and in
C:\Users\Public\Documents\EASE40Data on machines using Vista.</b></p>
<p><b>If you are installing 4.3 on a computer that has not had EASE
installed on it previously, the install program will automatically use the MS
recommended path structure. If you are updating a previous EASE installation to
4.3, the install program will give you the opportunity to <i>“Reset all
installation adjustments to default values”</i>, meaning set them to the MS
recommended file structure. VISTA users must select this option; it is optional
for XP users, but for consistency and standardization we recommend selecting
this option and using the new MS recommended file structure.</b></p>
<p><b>Note: If you are updating an existing EASE installation under
VISTA or will be using the MS recommended file structure under XP, you must
first “Upload “ your License Key. Otherwise, you will lose your License Key
during the update. Open EASE and go to <i>Help\Registe</i>r and press the <i>Upload</i>
button to upload your license key.</b></p>
<p><b>If you are updating an existing installation to the MS file
structure, be aware that doing a Complete install will probably cre-ate a
second set of data files unless you move your old data files before installing
the new ones.</b></p>
<p>The install program will not detect the existing EASE40Data
folder on your C: drive and will create a new one. To prevent this from
happening, XP users should first move their EASE40Data folder to C:\ Documents
and Settings\All Users\ Shared Documents\ and Vista users to <i>C:\Users\Public\Documents\.</i>
The install program will then detect the old data and give you
the option of leaving it un-touched or of overwriting/updating it.</p>
<p>Doing a Program Only install will not produce a second set of data
files, but after the installation is completed you will probably want to move
your old data/project files to the new directory locations or change the path
setups in EASE to point to the old file locations.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>If you are installing 4.3 from CD’s:</b></p>
<p>Insert the EASE 4.3 Program CD into your CD drive. The Install
program should open automatically. If it doesn’t, from the Start menu select <i>Settings</i>,
then <i>Control Panel</i> and <i>Add/Remove Programs</i>. Click on <i>Install</i>
and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>Note: If for some reason Windows can not locate the EASE setup
program, click on the <i>Browse</i> button to manually locate the Setup program
on the EASE 4.3 CD. Double-click on the <i>Setup.exe</i> file to launch the
Setup program.</p>
<p>Then, insert the EASE 4.3 EASE Guard License Control CD and
install the license control program. You will not be able to register your
program and obtain a license key until the license control program is installed.</p>
<p><b>If you are downloading and installing 4.3 from the web:</b></p>
<p>Go to the AFMG Download Portal, <b><a
href="http://www.afmg-support.eu/afmgdlportal/start.aspx">http://www.afmg-support.eu/afmgdlportal/start.aspx</a></b> and
enter your e-mail address and password. If you forgot your password, put in
your e-mail address and click on <i>Submi</i>t. If a password was previously
issued to the e-mail address you entered, it will be sent to you automatically
by e-mail. If the e-mail address does not match an existing password, AFMG will
get in touch with you.</p>
<p>If this is your first visit to the download portal and you
haven’t established an account and obtained a password, you will have to
register to obtain one. Click on <i>Don’t have an account? Create One</i> and
complete the registration form. Fill in the fields as best as you can. The
program won’t accept your request until you have filled out all the fields.</p>
<p><img width=498 height=246
src="E1.files/image006.jpg"></p>
<p>If</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>up-</p>
<p>dating an existing program and don’t know your User’s ID number,
open Win-dows Explorer and browse to <i>C:\Program Files\EASE 4.0\
EasePath\User ID</i>. Your User ID is stored there. Note that on your computer,
the EASE file may be identified EASE 4.1,EASE 4.2 or EASE 4.3 instead of EASE
4.0.</p>
<p><img width=276 height=318
src="E1.files/image007.jpg"></p>
<p>When you have your password enter it into the Password field and
press <i>Log</i> <i>In </i>to open the download window.</p>
<p>When the Download window opens, select <i>Program Setups</i> and
download ei-ther the <i>Program Only Setup</i> or the <i>Complete CD Setup</i>.
The Complete CD Setup includes the associated Data Files (Speaker &amp;
Material data files, etc.) which you will need if you are installing EASE for
the first time on your ma-chine. The Program Only Setup does not include the
data files. When the Save As dialog box appears note where the file will be
saved on your computer.</p>
<p>If EASE Guard is not already installed on your machine from a
previous 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 installation, also select <i>Licence Guard Setups</i>
and download the EASE Guard setup archive belonging to your EASE User ID.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Make sure that you have Microsoft .NET 2.0 Framework installed
on your machine. Ease 4.3 needs it to operate. If you don’t have it, click on
Net Framework to connect to the MS download site and download it.</p>
<p>The EASE GLL Viewer is a separate program that allows users to
view GLL loudspeaker data created in AFMG’s SpeakerLab program and stored in
the GLL data format. Both are new no-charge additions to EASE and becoming
increasingly popular as more manufacturers de-velop loudspeaker data in the GLL
format.</p>
<p>The GLL (Generic Loudspeaker Library) is a comprehensive,
descriptive, object oriented loudspeaker data format designed to store and
exchange complex data on loudspeaker systems and other acoustic sources. If you
are not familiar with the GLL concept, refer to the GLL/SpeakerLab section of
this manual.</p>
<p>We suggest you download and install both the GLL Viewer and
SpeakerLab and become familiar with them. One word of caution; if you decide to
Install SpeakerLab, be sure to also download the <i>SpeakerLab User Files
Setups</i>. EASE and SpeakerLab are separate programs and have separate license
keys. You will need the SpeakerLab User Files to obtain a license key for
SpeakerLab.</p>
<p>When the downloads are completed, extract (unzip) the <i>EASE4.3.zip</i>
file. You may also want to burn the contents of the EASE CD setup folder onto a
CD for backup purposes. If you will be installing 4.3 on several machines, it’s
a lot easier to do it from a CD than it is to re-peatedly download it.</p>
<p><b>Remember: If you are updating an existing EASE installation, you
need to first “Upload “ your License Key. Otherwise, you will lose your license
key during the update. Open EASE and go to <i>Help\Register</i> and press the <i>Upload</i>
button.</b></p>
<p>If you are updating an existing installation to the MS file
structure, be aware that doing a Complete install will probably create a second
set of data files unless you move your old data files before installing the new
ones.</p>
<p>The install program will not detect the existing EASE40Data
folder on your C: drive and will create a new one. To prevent this from
happen-ing, XP users should first move their EASE40Data folder to C:\ Documents
and Settings\All Users\Shared Documents\ and Vista users to <i>C:\Users\Public\Documents\.
</i>The install program will then detect the old data and give you the option
of leaving it untouched or of overwrit-ing/updating it.</p>
<p>Doing a Program Only install will not produce a second set of
data files, but after the installation is completed you will probably want to
move your old data/project files to the new directory locations or change the
path setups in EASE to point to the old file locations.</p>
<p>When you ready to begin the installation, double click on <i>Setup.exe</i>
in the EASE 4.3 folder to start the installation.</p>
<p>During the installation you may encounter <i>Shared File
Detected</i> and <i>Read Only File Detected</i> dialog boxes. In both cases
select <i>Don’t dis-play this message again </i>and then click on<i> Yes.</i></p>
<p><img width=320 height=248
src="E1.files/image008.jpg"></p>
<p>After accepting the License Agreement, an EASE 4.3 Setup window
will open; select the <i>Complete</i> install unless you have reason to install
only the program or just the data files.</p>
<p>The EASE program will install first.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>Chapter 1: Installation and Registration</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>If you are updating an existing installation, a Remove or Repair
dia-log box will open next. Select <i>Remove</i>.</p>
<p><img width=441 height=643
src="E1.files/image009.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Reset all installation adjustments to default values</i>
box needs to be checked by all VISTA users who are updating an earlier 4.xx
in-stallation. We also recommend that XP users do the same.</p>
<p>Installation of the data files will begin as soon as the EASE
program files have been installed . All you need to do is to follow the prompts
and select the data you want to install.</p>
<p>We recommend installing the Examples and either the English or
German Material Database. You definitely need one of the Material databases.</p>
<p>Note that before the Speaker Data installa-tion begins, you are
given the option of pre-selecting all the Speaker Data files for installation
or of proceeding to the next screen and individually selecting the file you
want.</p>
<p>The complete Speaker Database includes over 80 manufacturer’s
products and occu-pies over 600 MB of disk space, so you may want to pick and
choose what manu-facturers you want to include in your data-base. You can
always add one of the manufacturer’s databases at a later time.</p>
<p>After the EASE installation is completed, the installer will
proceed to install SpeakerLab and the GLL Viewer. Just follow the prompts to
in-stall them.</p>
<p>When the program installation is complete, in-stall the EASE
Guard license control program from the EASE 4.3 EASE Guard License Con-trol CD
or by executing the EASE Guard setup file you downloaded from the web.</p>
<p><img width=319 height=228
src="E1.files/image010.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Note that:</b></p>
<p><b>1. Before you can use EASE, you will have to install the
EASE Guard License Control program and download a license key.</b></p>
<p><b>2. Before you can use SpeakerLab, you will have to install
the</b></p>
<p><b>SpeakerLab User Files and go to the AFMG License Manager on your
desktop to download a SpeakerLab license key.</b></p>
<p><b>3. The EASE GLL Viewer does not require a license key.</b></p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Registration Instructions</b></p>
<p>Your EASE JR / EASE License allows you to install and run the
program simultaneously on 2 machines. Use of the program is controlled by
License Keys (sometimes referred to as User Keys) issued by AFMG with each EASE
License entitling you to 2 License Keys.</p>
<p>If you want to use the program on more than 2 machines, you must
purchase additional License Keys. Additional License Keys are avail-able in
sets of two and allow you to use the program on 2 additional machines.</p>
<p>License Keys are managed and controlled by the EASE Guard
License Control program.</p>
<p>Note that SpeakerLab is a separate program and has its own
License Manager program and license keys. Please refer to Chapter 14 for
details.</p>
<p>Key elements of the EASE Guard license control program are the:</p>
<p><b>USER ID Number</b></p>
<p>The USER ID number is the identification number assigned to your
company at the time you purchased the License. It includes details on any
previous EASE licenses you owned and identifies what version of EASE you
purchased; for example EASE or EASE JR. You cannot obtain License Keys without
it.</p>
<p>If you received delivery of your program over the web, your User
ID number was included in the e-mail letter of download instructions you
received from AFMG. If you purchased backup CD’s, you will find your USER ID
number on the rear of the EASE and EASE Guard CD jewel cases.</p>
<p><b>Reference File</b></p>
<p>The Reference File (sometimes called Reference Key) is a file
(an .erf Ease Reference File) generated by the EASE Guard license control
program. It identifies your computer and its operating system and is linked to
your License Key. This file is different for each computer.</p>
<p>Any change in your computer’s operating system will be detected
by EASE Guard and the link between your computer and the Li-cense Key will be
broken and you will no longer be able to use the program. You will have lost
your License Key and will not be able to run EASE until you have obtained a
replacement from AFMG.</p>
<p><b>License File</b></p>
<p>The License File (usually called a License Key or a Users key,
and sometimes referred to as a a Seat) is a file (an .elf Ease License File)
generated by ADA. It is linked to your USER ID Number and to your computer’s
Reference File and unlocks the specific EASE version you purchased.</p>
<p><b>Obtaining a License Key</b></p>
<p>1. As soon as the EASE Guard installation is completed,
start EASE by double clicking on the EASE Icon.</p>
<p>2. Then double click on the Register Icon in the EASE
4.3 desktop window or open the Help pull down menu and select <i>Register</i>.
This will open the EASE Registra-tion prompt shown below.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 1: Installation and Registration</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>3. Answering <i>Yes</i> will bring up the dialog box shown
below.</p>
<p><img width=343 height=95
src="E1.files/image012.jpg"></p>
<p>An affirmative answer will close EASE, launch the EASE Guard
program and open the window shown below.</p>
<p><img width=454 height=252
src="E1.files/image013.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that it tells you a valid license has not been installed
on your computer.</p>
<p>Clicking on the big Download License button will connect you to
the EASE license key download site on the ADA server, send your com-puter’s
reference information to the site and, if everything checks out, generate your
License Key and install it on your computer. The entire operation is automated
and takes only a few seconds.</p>
<p>Notice that after the License Key has been installed, the
License Status fields will now show what version of EASE is installed, your
com-pany name and the number of license keys installed on your computer. It
will show 1, since you downloaded only one License Key.</p>
<p><img width=454 height=252
src="E1.files/image014.jpg"></p>
<p>If you now press the <i>Info</i> button, it will tell you how
many License Keys are still available for download. Do not download them onto
your computer unless you have a specific need for them. They are safer on ADA’s
site than they would be stored on your computer.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>If you have a second computer with Web access, you can download
a License Key to it by following the same procedure you used with the first
computer. Other users within your company can also obtain License Keys for
their computers, if additional License Keys are available.</p>
<p>The license key download feature usually works flawlessly. If it
doesn’t, an error message will let you know there is a problem.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=108
src="E1.files/image015.jpg"></p>
<p>One common reason for the download procedure not working
properly is that your Firewall/Virus protection system is blocking the
download. Try turning it Off.</p>
<p><img width=192 height=255
src="E1.files/image016.jpg"></p>
<p>If you do not have automatic access to the Web and must “log on”
to gain access, be sure to “log on” to the Web before starting the Online
Licensing procedure. It could be that the download procedure is “timing out”
before the connection is established.</p>
<p>Your browser’s HTTP1.1 setting can also be the source of the
problem.Open your browser’s property’s folder and checking its setting. It
should be set to “<i>Use HTTP1.1</i>” if you do not have a proxy server between
your computer and the web. Otherwise, set it to <i>“User</i> <i>HTTP1.1 through
proxy connections”.</i></p>
<p>If none of these suggestions solve the problem, open the <i>Register</i>
window and click on <i>Licensing by File. </i>See below. Note that the right
portion of the window changes and intro-duces new buttons and tabs.</p>

<p><b>Licensing By File</b></p>
<p>1. From the <i>Licensing by File/Register</i> window, click
on the <i>Create Reference File</i> button. When the <i>Save As</i> dialog box
appears select the stor-age location for the .erf file; for example, <i>Desktop</i>
or <i>My Documents</i>. Click on Save.</p>
<p><img width=365 height=251
src="E1.files/image018.jpg"></p>
<p>When the process is completed, a dialog box will appear asking
if you want to automatically send this file to ADA.</p>
<p>If you are using Outlook as your e-mail server, answering <i>Yes</i>
will open an e-mail template ad-dressed to ADA with the .erf attached. In the
body of the e-mail, ask for a License Key and <i>send </i>the e-mail to them.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours (weekends excluded) you will receive an e-mail
response from them with an .elf Ease License File attached. Copy the .elf file
to a storage location on your computer. The return to the <i>Registration/Licensing
by File</i> window and press the <i>Install License</i> button. Browse to the
.elf file and install it into EASE (press <i>Save</i>).</p>
<p>ADA also maintains a license key download site which enables you
to download the .elf License Key without the delay associated with using
e-mails to request and receive the file. Open your web browser and go to:</p>

<p><b>Exporting License Keys</b></p>
<p>From time to time you may want to Export (move) a License Key
from your computer to another computer.</p>
<p>To Export a License Key, in the Register/Licensing by File window
click on the Import/Export tab to open the window shown below.</p>
<p><img width=487 height=272
src="E1.files/image020.jpg"></p>
<p>Exporting a License Key from your computer (we’ll call it the
Source computer) to another Computer (referred to as the Target computer in the
program) is a multi-step procedure:</p>
<p>1. First, you must load EASE and EASE Guard on the Target
computer and obtain its Reference File. Open EASE on the Target computer and go
to <i>Register/Licensing by File</i> and <i>Import/Expor</i>t to open the
window shown above; click on the <i>Create Reference File</i> button. This will
generate the Target computer’s .ERF Reference File; follow the prompts to save
it to a logical location. Then transfer (move) it to your computer.</p>
<p>2. Open EASE Guard in your computer (the Source computer)
and go to the Import/Export window and click on the big <i>Export License</i>
but-ton. This will open an Open File dialog window; browse to the .ERF
Reference File you just created, select it and click on <i>Open</i>. This will
link the Reference File to your computer’s License Key and generate a .ELF Ease
License File. Follow the prompts to save it to a logical location and then
transfer (move) it to the Target computer.</p>
<p><img width=389 height=289
src="E1.files/image021.jpg"></p>
<p>3. Return to the Import/Export window on the Target computer
and press the <i>Import License</i> button to open an Open File dialog box.
Browse to the .ELF File, select it and then click on <i>Open</i> to install the
License Key on the Target computer.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Terminating (Removing) License Keys</b></p>
<p>There are two ways to remove a license key from your computer to
prevent its being lost while you upgrade your operating system or when you are
replacing it with a new computer. This protects you from losing your License
Key in the transition. Remember, any change in your computer’s operating system
will be detected by EASE Guard and the link between your computer and the
License Key will be broken.</p>
<p>The recommended way, and the simplest way, is to Upload your
License Key to the ADA site and then Download it after your system is up-graded
or Download it onto your new computer. To do this, open EASE and go to <i>Register</i>
under the <i>Help</i> pull down menu and click on the <i>Upload </i>button.</p>
<p>If you have problems uploading the License Key, you can also
officially terminate it. To terminate your computer’s License Key, select the <i>Terminate
</i>folder under the<i> Register/Licensing By File </i>window. Then press the<i>
Terminate Licence </i>button.</p>
<p><img width=410 height=228
src="E1.files/image022.jpg"></p>
<p>This will open a Save File window. Enter a logical location for
the file and then click on <i>Save</i>. A Send E-mail Now prompt will appear.
If you are running Outlook, clicking on <i>Yes</i> will send the Termination
file to ADA. If you don’t have direct access to the web or the e-mail template doesn’t
open, Save the file and then use a computer that has E-mail capabilities to
E-mail it to licence@ada-acousticdesign.de. Be sure to tell ADA why you
have sent the Termination file to them and ask them to place a replacement key
in your file.</p>
<p><b>Remove License</b></p>
<p>The Remove License button in the Terminate window is used only
to correct licensing problems resulting from software or hardware errors. Don’t
use it unless you are having problems and you are told to use it by ADA or the
Renkus-Heinz support staff. Don’t use it without our knowledge and consent, as
it will remove all licensing information from your computer and complicate the
task of recovering a lost License Key.</p>
<p><b>Protect Licence</b></p>
<p>For those who want to maintain tight control over their EASE
License Keys, EASE 4.3 includes a Protect Licence feature. It is accessible
under the Help pull down menu.</p>
<p>Protect Licence, when activated, removes the EASE Guard License
Control program from the computer without removing the License Key. This makes
it impossible for the user to access the EASE website to upload or download
additional License Keys or to export the key to another computer.</p>
<p><b>Program Updates</b></p>
<p>The development staff at ADA is constantly updating the EASE
program. The latest updates are stored on the ADA site and can easily be
downloaded by any licensed EASE user having access to the web. Open the <i>Help</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Ease Update</i> to connect to the ADA download
portal.</p>

<p><b>Speaker and Material Database Updates</b></p>
<p>The latest updates to the loudspeaker and wall material
databases are also available to you. Selecting <i>DataBase Update</i> from the <i>Help</i>
pull down menu will open the Update Manager. The down arrow allows you to
select either the Speaker or the Material database for review.</p>
<p><img width=360 height=778
src="E1.files/image023.jpg"></p>
<p>Clicking on <i>Check Base Status and</i> <i>Compare With Web
Catalog </i>will<i> </i>compare the database on your computer with the ADA
maintained database and produce a listing of the data files that are missing
and/or have been updated. All you need to do is the check the files you want to
download.</p>

<p><b>Recovering Lost License Keys</b></p>
<p>At some point in time through no fault oy your own you may lose
a License Key. Your hard drive will crash and burn, someone unfamiliar with
EASE will decide to reformat your computer without your knowledge or some other
unforeseen event will occur.</p>
<p>When this happens, it is important that you get in touch with
ADA and ask for a replacement as soon as possible. Don’t wait until you have an
urgent need to use the program</p>
<p>Recovering a lost EASE or EASE JR license key is a relatively
simple process , but it usually takes at least 24 hours as each request is
personally reviewed.</p>
<p>Open EASE/EASE JR on any machine that has both EASE and EASE
Guard installed.</p>
<p>Select <i>Create Status Report</i> from the Help pull down menu.</p>

<p>Create Status Report will gather all the computers licensing
files into a single EASE40Info.Zip file that you can send to ADA along with a
request for a replacement license key.</p>
<p>Note: If the EASE program won’t open, go to <i>Start/All
Programs/EASE/Tools</i> and click on <i>Create Status Report</i> to activate
it.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Create Status Report</i> will open the familiar
Window’s “Save” screen giving you the opportunity to save the file under
another name and/or to choose a different file location.. We suggest you accept
the default name and location. Clicking on Save will open the dia-log screen
shown below.</p>

<p>If you are using Outlook as your e-mail client, clicking on <i>Yes</i>
will open an e-mail template addressed to ADA with the .info file attached.</p>
<p>If you are not using Outlook you may have to create a new e-mail
to ADA and attach the .info file to it. The automatic send routine does not
work on all e-mail clients.</p>
<p>The e-mail should be sent to <i>licence@ada-acousticdesign.de</i>.
Be sure to explain in the body of the e-mail what has happened and ask for a
replacement license key. Otherwise, ADA won’t know why you sent the info file
to them. You should hear from them within a working day.</p>
