<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>In Constructing a Model we covered the construction of a basic
room model in EASE using the x,y,z coordinate method. In this section, we will
become acquainted with the wide array of modeling tools offered by EASE 4.3.and
explore the use of Create Shapes and prototypes to reduce the amount of
modeling time required.</p>
<p>Certain complex shapes, curved surfaces in particular, can be
both difficult and time consuming to enter with the techniques we learned while
constructing our Model_1 Tutorial room. Other modeling tasks, such as adding
row upon row of bleachers or installing a distributed loudspeaker system in the
ceiling of a room can be very time consuming without using shortcuts. There
also will be times when it would be nice to be able to cut a Face into two or three
parts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, EASE includes a number of tools that make these
tasks a snap. Please take the time to at least scan this section of the
Tuto-rial to get a feeling for how these tasks can be handled. Knowing that
these tools are available could save you hours on your next model-ing job.</p>
<p><b>Adding Windows and Doors</b></p>
<p>We did not include windows or doors in our Model_1 room. Now.
let’s add windows to dress up our model.</p>
<p>As the first step, open the Model_1 room and do a <i>Save
Project As</i> to create a new project. It’s always a good practice to save the
original project before doing any major modifications. We’ll call it Model_2.
Note that the Save File dialog box directs the new file to the Tutorial folder.</p>
<p><img width=248 height=183
src="E1.files/image117.jpg"></p>
<p>We’ll use the Coat and Duplicate/Displace features to add three
4-foot by 6-foot windows to the side walls for practice. We'll put them on 14
foot centers starting 10 feet from the rear wall and place them 3 feet up from
the floor.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do create the window Face, the two
most popular are using Duplicate/Displace and with Extrude. We'll go through
the Duplicate/Displace method first.</p>
<p><img width=313 height=215
src="E1.files/image118.jpg"></p>
<p>The coordinates for the first Vertex will be -25, -65, 3 and
that is all the Vertex info we need to know to create the window's other 3
Vertices using Duplicate/Displace. Select the <i>Insert Vertex [v]</i> tool and
then click on the screen to add the Vertex. Then enter the coordinate
information into the pop up screen to properly locate the Vertex.</p>
<p>Next, right click on the screen to open the Mouse menu and
select <i>Dupli-cate </i>to bring up the Displacement screen; type 4 into the<i>
y-value </i>field to<i> </i>locate the other lower corner of the window and <i>OK</i>
the move. Next, use <i>Duplicate </i>to create the top corners of the window
(hint: displace the z lo-cation by 6). The next step is to add the Face. Click
on the <i>Add Face</i> <i>tool [f] </i>and then on the window's Vertices to
make the Face.</p>
<p>When the Properties folder opens, use <i>WindGlass</i> for the
material. Then use the Coat feature to Coat the window onto the wall (don't
for-get to make it a Two-Fold Face). Note that if you don't know the Face
number of the wall, you will need to return to the Edit Project window to get
it. You can't Coat a Face onto another Face unless you know its Face number.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The Extrude method is even simpler. Insert the first Vertex.
Then right click and select <i>Extrude</i>. Put a 4 in the y axis field and a 6
in the z axis field. Click on <i>OK</i> and EASE will make the Face for you.</p>
<p>We'll use Duplicate/Displace to create the other Faces. Select
the Face and enter 14 in the y axis field. Then put a 2 in the <i>Repeated</i>
field.</p>
<p>Click on <i>OK</i> and it's done. It is that easy.</p>
<p><img width=659 height=265
src="E1.files/image119.jpg"></p>
<p>A word of caution about using <i>Coat Of</i> to paste one Face
on top of another. EASE automatically moves the Face being coated onto an-other
Face a small distance away from the other Face. By coating our first window
onto the wall that faces into the room (by placing the first Vertex on the
reflective wall, Face F6 in the model)l), we made sure the window would be
placed inside the Room. If we had placed the first Vertex on the outside of the
wall (Face F6* in the model), the program would have placed the window outside
the room.</p>
<p><b>Using Edges &amp; Vertex On Face Margin</b></p>
<p>Edges (lines drawn between two Vertices) only serve to add
detail to a model for cosmetic purposes. They are not considered in any
calcu-lations.</p>
<p>As an example of their use, lets use Edges to add four panes to
the windows in our model. The first step will be to insert Vertices into the
Margins (edges) of one of the existing windows.</p>
<p>Hint, you may want to Zoom In on the window to better observe
the procedure.</p>
<p><img width=242 height=167
src="E1.files/image120.jpg"></p>
<p>We’ll use the <i>Vertex On Face Margin</i> command to do this.
Select one of the windows, open the Mouse Menu and select Vertex On Face
Margin. Then click on one of the edges of the window, let’s say the bottom
edge. The program will insert the Vertex into the edge of the window at the
point you clicked. Now all you need to do is to make sure it is in the right
position.</p>
<p>Select the Vertice and right click on it to open its Properties
window. You’ll find that the only coordinate you need to change is the y
coordinate. Correct it and then hit <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>If you were to open the Window’s Properties folder now, you
would see that the new Vertice has been added to the listing of the window’s
Vertices. It is now part of the</p>
<p>window. Repeat the procedure to add a Vertice to the top of the
window, Then click on the <i>Insert Edge [e]</i> tool and connect the two
Vertices together. Repeat the procedure to put Vertices into the sides of the
window and create an Edge between them.</p>
<p>If you have trouble selecting the new Vertice after it is
inserted, use the Find <i>[Ctrl F]</i> command to select it.</p>

<p><b>Finding Unknown Coordinate Locations</b></p>
<p>While modeling a Room, it is not unusual to encounter situations
where an exact dimension is required, but not shown on the blueprints and the
approximate figure provided by scaling is not good enough for EASE. EASE
demands that Faces be flat (planar) and that Faces meet perfectly! It doesn't
like holes!</p>
<p>Situations like this often occur in the Chancel area of churches
when a section of the rear wall is brought forward to provide an exit into the
Sacristy. See drawing below.</p>
<p><b>Z Dimension Unknown</b></p>
<p><img width=482 height=323
src="E1.files/image121.jpg"></p>
<p>0, 0, 25</p>
 <p>22,</p>
 <p>-24, 0</p>
 <p>-25, 0, 12</p>
 <p>2, -24,</p>
 <p>0</p>
<p>-2, -24, 0</p>
<p>-25, 0, 2</p>
<p><img width=7 height=7
src="E1.files/image122.jpg"> -22, -24, 0</p>
<p>-25, -20, 0</p>
<p>The problem is the z coordinate dimension for the Vertices that
mark the intersection of the walls with the roof. The x and y coordinate
fig-ures at the floor level are usually either given or are easy to measure and
they are the same for the upper Vertices. The z dimension is the one that quite
often is an unknown! Fortunately, EASE can help find this dimension. It’s done
using the ability of EASE to Extrude Vertices and Edges.</p>
<p>The first step is to insert one of the four corner Vertices into
the floor of the Chancel. Assuming the section being added is 4 feet deep and
10 feet across, the x, y, z Coordinates for the floor Vertices would be -5, 0,
2 &amp; -5, -4, 2 and 5, 0, 2 &amp; 5, -4, 2. First, <i>Pick</i> the Chancel
floor Face (F5) and then right click to bring up the Mouse menu. Notice that
there are two commands that deal with Vertices, <i>Vertex On</i> <i>Face Margin
</i>and<i> Vertex On Face</i>. The<i> Vertex On Face Margin </i>will insert a
Vertice into the Edge of a Face while the<i> Vertex On Face </i>places<i> </i>the
Vertex within the Face.</p>
<p>We'll use the Vertex on Face Margin to add the Vertice at -5, 0,
2 and let EASE put in its mirror image Vertice at 5, 0, 2. Select <i>Vertex On</i>
<i>Face Margin </i>and use your Mouse to place the Vertice at approximately its
correct location on the edge of F5. Left click at that location to<i> </i>add
the Vertice. EASE will put in its mirror image. Pick one of the two Vertices
that were added, then right click on it to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Properties</i>.
Change the x coordinate to -5 and hit <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Now, <i>Pick</i> the Chancel floor, Face F5 and open its
Properties sheet. Note that the new Vertices have been added to the Face's
descrip-tion. Next check the rear wall, Face F8, in the same fashion. You will
find the new Vertices have also been automatically added to this Face.</p>
<p>We’ll use the <i>Vertex On Face</i> command to insert the floor
Vertices at -5, -4, 2 and 5, -4, 2. Pick Face F5, and right click to open the
Mouse menu and select <i>Vertex on Face</i> from the Mouse menu. Next, left
click on Face 5 to add the Vertice and enter the correct coordi-nate
information when the Properties sheet opens.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that we didn't actually have to use the <i>Vertex on Face
Margin</i> and <i>Vertex On Face</i> commands. We could have just inserted one
of the floor Vertices at its proper coordinate location and then proceeded on
to the next step. It was good practice, though.</p>
<p>The next step is to Extrude one of the floor Vertices from the
floor to the ceiling Face. Select one of the Vertices, right click to open the
Mouse menu and then select <i>Extrude</i> to open the Extrude window shown on
the left below. Note that you'll have to click on the <i>Options</i> button to
open the Options portion of the window.</p>
<p><img width=173 height=190
src="E1.files/image123.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=177 height=291
src="E1.files/image124.jpg"></p>
<p>Insert 1 in the z field and check <i>Create Edge and Extrude to
Next Face</i> and click <i>OK</i>. This will extrude the Vertex to the Ceiling
Face and insert an Edge at the same time. See below.</p>
<p><img width=511 height=312
src="E1.files/image125.jpg"></p>
<p>In this situation we didn’t have to insert a positive figure in
the z field to tell the program what direction to Extrude to the next Face.
There will be cases, though, where it will be necessary to tell the program
what direction to Extrude and we wanted to acquaint you with the pos-sibility.</p>
<p>If you want to verify that the top Vertices were placed at the
proper height, switch to the end view. You will see that they are.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Now all we need to do is Extrude one of the Edges we just
created 4 feet in the y direction and we'll have two of the three Faces we need
in place. See below.</p>
<p><img width=507 height=308
src="E1.files/image126.jpg"></p>
<p>We could stop here, since you now know how to put in Vertices,
Edges and Faces when one of the coordinates is unknown. As it turns out, you
didn't need to know the unknown coordinate's exact location. However, let's continue
the room modification to gain experience in modifying rooms.</p>
<p>We'll start by adding the third Face (the front Face) to the
section we are building. The first step is to add the Vertex where the new
section meets the apex of the roof. Pick the Vertex at the end of the building
and use Duplicate/Displace to put in the new Vertex (Displace it -4 feet in the
y direction). Now adding the third Face is as simple as connecting the five
Vertices that define this Face. Use the <i>Insert Face</i> Icon or the <i>f</i>
key command and insert the Face.</p>
<p>All that remains is to get rid of the surface areas that are no
longer part of the Room. To do this, we’ll need to delete the chancel floor,
the roof and the two back wall Faces and replace them with new Faces. Pick them
and hit the <i>Delete</i> key. Then use the <i>Insert Face [f]</i> tool to put
in the new Faces. In the process of adding the rear wall Faces you’ll discover
that you need to add two new Vertices. See drawing on the next page. The best
way to do this is to use the <i>Vertex On Face Margin</i> command. Otherwise,
you’ll have to eventually blow away (delete) the two side wall Faces and redraw
them to include the new Vertices.</p>
<p>Helpful Hints</p>
<p>1. Don’t be afraid to make a mistake. If you do, you
always have the <i>Undo</i> command to fix it by stepping back to just before
you made the mistake.</p>
<p>2. You may want to delete and replace the Faces one by
one, instead of deleting all of them at once and then starting to redraw them.
If you delete too much of a model at one time, it’s easy to lose track of which
Vertice is which.</p>
<p>3. Before you start to enter a new Face, make sure you
have a clear view of all the Vertices that will go into the Face so it will be
easy to pick them. Use the scroll bars to turn and rotate the drawing and your
Mouse wheel to Zoom in and out until you get a clear view.</p>
<p>When you are finished adding the new Faces, you'll notice that
you have a Vertice left over, the one that used to be at the end of the roof
peak. Blow it away by selecting it and then hitting the <i>Delete</i> key.</p>
<p>Note that if you had been building this model from scratch
instead of modifying an existing model you would have had to create Ceiling
Faces before you could Extrude the floor Vertice to the ceiling. To do this you
would have had to insert a vertice at the end of the roof peak. When done, your
Room should look like the one shown on the next page.</p>

<p>New Vertices</p>
<p><b>Distance Calculations</b></p>
<p>From time to time, you will want to know the exact distance
between two points in the room; for example, between the loudspeaker and a
listener at the rear of the room. EASE can do it for you.</p>
<p>Put in a <i>Listener Seat</i> at the rear of the room if your
model doesn’t already have one. Start by clicking on one of the Audience Areas
at the very rear of the area. Then use the Mouse menu to place a <i>Seat on
Area.</i></p>
<p>Next, Pick the Loudspeaker, then right click on it to bring up
the Mouse menu and select <i>Keep For Distance [Shift + k)</i>. Then <i>Pick</i>
one of the <i>Listener Seats</i>, right click for the Mouse menu and select <i>Show
Distance [Shift + 0 (zero)]</i>. This will introduce a pop up screen showing
the angular relationship between the two points, the physical distance between
them (the distance between the Loudspeaker and the Lis-tener Seat) and the time
needed for sound waves to cover the distance.</p>
<p>Note that as long as <i>Keep For Distance</i> is selected on the
Loudspeaker, you can also easily check the distance between the Loudspeaker and
any point in the room just by clicking on the desired point and then using <i>Shift
+ 0 (zero</i>).</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Create Shape Examples</b></p>
<p>The Create Shape 3D, Line Array and Circular Array sections of
the Insert pull down menu can be used effectively to create complex shapes with
a minimum of effort. Create Shape is also used to place columns and other
objects inside the room.</p>
<p>Lets create a new name for this model. We'll call it <i>Circus</i>.
Open EASE and choose <i>New Projec</i>t under the File menu (or use the desktop
Icon to Start Working and Create Project) and enter the name Tutorial in the <i>Hall</i>
field and Circus in the <i>Project File Name</i> field. We want to place the
Circus files in the Tutorial folder. Approve the setup by clicking on <i>Create</i>
and then go to <i>Room Info/Data</i> under the <i>View</i> pull down menu and
enter Circus in the <i>Project Version</i> field. Then click on OK and the <i>Edit
Project</i> module will open automatically.</p>
<p><img width=345 height=273
src="E1.files/image129.jpg"></p>
<p>For the first exercise, let’s create a room similar to the
Model_1 room we built in Section 3 of this Tutorial. We'll do this by first
making a box and then adding a roof to it. Select <i>Create Shape 3D</i> from
the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and then choose <i>Cuboid</i> (sometimes
called a shoebox) from the drop down listing at the top of the Create Shape
window.</p>
<p>Notice that you can choose between a Cuboid, Pyra-mid, Cupola,
Cylinder and Cone. We’ll practice with all of these before we finish this
section of the Tutorial.</p>
<p>We want to make a room 75' long, 50' wide and 12' high (not
including the roof). Notice that we inserted No into the <i>With Ceiling</i>
box field. We don't want to put in a ceiling, because we will be adding the
roof (ceiling) as the next step in building the room.</p>
<p>The <i>Hollow Polyhedron</i> box determines the orientation of
the Faces. When checked, it places all the reflective surfaces (the Faces)
facing into the room which is what we want. Clicking <i>OK</i> will generate
the room below.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E1.files/image130.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that the program put the 0, 0, 0 point in the center of
the room instead of at one end. We could have put this point at one end by
changing the <i>Center (Ft.) y</i> location from 0 to -37.5 in the Create Shape
dialog box. (Convention suggests that the y= 0 point should be at the front
wall of the room or the front of the stage, with the room extending in the
negative y direction.) The reason for this is that EASE, by default, aims the
loudspeakers in the negative y direction.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>If we want to change the 0, 0, 0 location at this time, we can
easily do so by going to the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and selecting <i>Move
Room Origin.</i> Move Room Origin opens a screen that allows you to chance the
0, 0, 0 coordinate locations. Try it out; insert -37.5 in the y field and <i>OK</i>
the change.</p>
<p><img width=178 height=196
src="E1.files/image131.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that Move Room Origin moves the Room and not the point of
origin. That’s why we used -37.5 instead of 37.5. Remember this point as it
will come up again as we move through the Tutorial.</p>
<p>We also could have created this cuboid by inserting a single
Vertex into the drawing and then ex-truding it the proper distances along the
x, y and z axis. In EASE, there usually is more than one way to quickly and
easily accomplish an objective. The choice of which method to use often hinges
upon personal preference. At other times it can make a big difference in the
amount of time re-quired. Our goal is to make you aware of the various options.</p>
<p>Our next step will be to add a peaked roof to the model. Return
to <i>Create Shape 3D</i> under the <i>In-sert </i>pull down menu only this
time select<i> Pyramid</i>. When the Create Shape/Pyramid dialog win-dow
appears, fill in the data fields as shown.</p>
<p><img width=179 height=343
src="E1.files/image132.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that we placed the <i>Floor Level</i> (the base of the
pyramid) at 12 feet (the height of the walls) and said Yes to <i>With Ceiling</i>,
but No to With Floor. We also set the Ceiling Width to 0 and the Ceil-ing
Length to 75. Setting the length to 0 would generate a true pyramid. Clicking
on <i>OK</i> will add the roof to our model and produce the room shown below.
Note that the program also created the two Faces that represent the triangular
top sections of the end walls.</p>
<p>At this point, you may want to check the orientation of the
Faces to verify that EASE entered them correctly. You'll see that they are
correct. You also may want to check the Vertices to verify that EASE did not
create &quot;stacked&quot; Vertices when it placed the roof on top of the
walls. Once again, you will find that EASE took care of everything.</p>
<p>Create Shapes is a quick and easy way to create a room. As a
general rule, though, the Prototype method is even faster when one of the
prototype rooms closely resembles the room you are con-structing. Prototypes
usually include Audience Areas, Listener Seats and Loudspeakers while these
items have to be added to rooms created with Create Shapes</p>
<p>In this case, for example, the Auditory w/Peaked Roof and Church
A rooms would probably be a better choice than Create Shapes. Refer to pages
108 to 121 for more details on the use of Proto-type Rooms.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Creating Curved Surfaces</b></p>
<p>For our next modeling exercise, let's create a room with a
curved rear wall and a flat ceiling. Our room will have a 10' ceiling and be
50' wide and 80' long overall. The rear wall will have a 10 foot arc.</p>
<p>We'll start by creating the curved wall. First, we need to get
rid of the room we created in the previous exercise. Two clicks on the <i>Undo</i>
tool button should take care of this.</p>
<p>The first step will be to put in the Vertices representing the
bottom of the wall. Select <i>Circular Array/Vertices</i> from the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu and use the left mouse button to insert 3 Vertices. The first
two Vertices represent the ends of the Arc and the third, the apex of the Arc.
Don't worry about where to place the Vertices, we'll be placing them in the
right location in the next step.</p>
<p><img width=342 height=327
src="E1.files/image134.jpg"></p>
<p>After inserting the first two Vertices, the Insert Circular
Array win-dow will open. Ignore it and insert the 3rd Vertice.</p>
<p>The Insert Circular Array window allows you to precisely define
the Arc's characteristics. <i>Starting Point(ft</i>) is the beginning of the
arc, <i>Point On Arc(ft)</i> is the apex and <i>Ending Point(ft</i>) is the
finish point. The figures shown are the proper ones for the room we are
creating. Enter them into the proper fields. Hint: Use your Tab key to move from
field to field.</p>
<p>You will see the Vertices move on the screen as you type in the
correct locations. If they move off the screen, you will need to Zoom Out or
hit the Home key to see them after you finish enter-ing the location
coordinates.</p>
<p>We chose to define the Arc with 10 points. This will result in a
wall having 9 Faces. Using more points would create more Faces and a smoother
arc, but would also lengthen computation times during the simulation routines.
Approving the setup by clicking on <i>OK</i> (or hitting <i>Enter</i>) will
produce 10 Vertices in the shape of an arc.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305

<p>86</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to turn these points into a Face. Choose the <i>Insert
Face [f]</i> tool and connect the Vertices together to make the Face. See
below.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E1.files/image136.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Using Extrude</b></p>
<p>We will use the Extrude feature of EASE to add walls and a
ceiling. Pick the floor Face and then right click to open the Mouse menu,
select <i>Extrude </i>and enter 10 into the<i> z </i>field of the Displacement
dialog box that opens.</p>
<p>This will extrude the Face (floor) up 10 feet and create the
curved wall and associated ceiling.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E1.files/image137.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that a front wall (face) was also created. We do not need
this, so pick it and blow it away (hit the Delete key).</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, we can add the rest of the room. We'll do this using <i>Create
Shape 3D/Cuboid</i> under the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu. We'll add a cuboid
70' in length, 10' in height and 50' in width, the size of the room minus the
curved end section, which represents the rear wall of the model. Note that the
default location for Y is 0,0,0. Since we created the curved section based on
the 0, 0, 0 point being at the center of the rear wall, we'll need to move this
point by -35. Insert -35 in the <i>Center [Ft.] y</i> field.</p>
<p>Approving the insertion by hitting <i>O</i>K will add the rest
of the room.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image002.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that once again we have an extra Face. Delete it and the
room is complete except for adding the surface materials. Simple, isn't it?</p>
<p>Hint: The quickest way to add the surface materials is to Pick a
Face, and use <i>Ctrl + F3</i> to do a global edit of surface materials. Select
the most common material used in the room, for instance PLAST/LTHR, and press <i>OK</i>
to turn all Faces (surfaces) into PLAST/LTHR. Now, only the Faces whose surface
material are not PLAST/LTHR need to be changed.</p>
<p>If the curved wall had been a semicircle, instead of an arc, we
would probably have used Create Cylinder under the Create Shape 3D menu to
create the curved section of the room. We'll take a look at using Create
Cylinder in the next exercise.</p>
<p>Note that we could also have created the cuboid section of the
room by Extruding one of the corner Vertices 50 Ft. in the x direction, 70 Ft.</p>
<p>in the y direction and 10 Ft.. in the z direction. Try it, it
works.</p>
<p>In actual practice we might have created the cuboid section of
the Room first and then added the curved rear section of the Room. Either way
works. It’s mainly a matter of personal preference.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to move on to another example, so use the Undo
icon to delete the room we just created. Be aware that if you had used F6 to
check and save data at any point while building the Room, the Undo command
wouldn’t completely delete the Room. It only goes back to the last saved point.</p>

<p><b>Creating Rooms with Curved Ceilings and Walls</b></p>
<p>For our next exercise, we'll create a more complex room. The
basic structure is 300' in width and length and has 60' walls. The peak of the
dome is 120' above the floor level. The side entrance extends out 90 feet from
the building and is 75 Ft. wide. We will call this room Circus_2</p>
<p>Notice that the building is symmetrical except for the side
entrance. We'll do all the modeling we can in the Symmetrical mode and then</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>turn off Symmetry and add the side entrance.</p>
<p>We will start the modeling process with the curved wall and
domed ceiling. Select <i>Create Shape3D</i> and use the drop down arrow to
select <i>Cylinder </i>from the Insert pull down menu to open the<i> Create
Shape /Cylinde</i>r window. Fill in the fields as shown on the next page and
then<i> </i>approve the insertion by clicking on OK.</p>
<p>Notice that we asked for a Cylinder with a floor, but without a
ceiling and for a <i>Hollow Polyhedron</i>. We want the reflective Faces on the
in-side of the cylinder. We also chose <i>12 Steps</i> instead of the default
value of 10 because this is a large room and we wanted the higher reso-lution.</p>
<p><img width=649 height=301

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to add the dome (cupola) to the top of the
cylinder. Return to the <i>Create Shape 3D</i> menu and select <i>Cupola</i>.</p>
<p><img width=657 height=301
src="E2.files/image005.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that we specified a dome with a Ceiling and no Floor and
placed the Floor Level at 60 Ft., the height of the walls. Clicking on <i>OK</i>
produces the model shown.</p>
<p>The next step is to &quot;blow away&quot; the Faces we don't
need. It's an easy task since in the symmetrical modeling mode EASE will delete
half of them. Pick one of the Faces that need to be deleted and hit the Delete
key. You will probably find this process easier if you start with one of the
wall Faces as there are fewer of them to delete.</p>
<p>Notice that after you have deleted a Face, the program helps you
by Picking the Face numbered one lower than the Face you deleted. You don't
have to actually Pick every Face. EASE does it for you. The only thing you have
to watch for is inadvertently deleting the floor while you are getting rid of
the unwanted wall and ceiling Faces. Haste makes waste.</p>
<p>You may also want to Zoom In on the Faces at the top of the dome
when you are deleting them. It make it a little easier.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305

<p>90</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>When all the Faces have been deleted, your model will look like
this.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image007.jpg"></p>
<p>All that remains is to delete the unwanted Vertices. This is
done simply by using the <i>Shift +Ctrl + F12</i> key stroke command that
deletes all unattached Vertices. The result appears below.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image008.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to change the shape of the floor. The uncovered
half needs to be a rectangular instead of being circular. We’ll do this by
moving (Displacing) the Vertices in that section of the floor to form a
rectangle.</p>
<p>Select either Vertex P3 or P3*. If you aren't sure which ones
they are, there are two easy ways to find them. One is to use the <i>Ctrl + F</i>
Find command and enter P3 or P3* in the Find field; the other is to turn On all
the Vertex Labels.</p>
<p>You can also Pick the floor Vertices one by one and use the
Status Bar at the bottom of the window to check its Vertice number until you
find P3 or P3*..</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, use the right Mouse button to open the Mouse menu and
select <i>Properties</i> or hit <i>F4</i> to open the Property sheet for Vertex
P3. Change its x coordinate to -150 and <i>OK</i> the setup. Then, select <i>P1</i>
and change both its x and its y coordinates to -150. When you finish this step,
the model will look like the one shown below.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image009.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, its time to add the curved ceiling over this section..
We'll start by adding the Vertices using the <i>Insert Circular Array/Vertex</i>
function we used in the previous exercise.</p>
<p>For this exercise though, we'll use a somewhat different tact.
We’ll change the editing plane in which we are working to make it easier to
in-sert these Vertices. We’ll also change to the <i>y (end)</i> view. There are
several ways to do this. One way is to open the Options menu by clicking on the
<i>Options [F9]</i> button in the tool bar section and select the <i>Editing</i>
tab. You can also change to the end view, right click on the screen to open the
Mouse menu and select <i>xz Plane Value</i>. Another and far easier way is to
use the <i>shift +y</i> key command. It automati-cally switches to the end view
and opens the Editing tab. Try it; it works.</p>
<p><img width=387 height=323
src="E2.files/image010.jpg"></p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Set the Editing Plane to the xz - Plane and the <i>Plane Value</i>
to -150. This assures that we will be working in the end wall of the structure.</p>
<p>Now, select <i>Circular Array/Vertices</i> from the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu. Notice that the cursor changes to a cross. Click on the two
lower cor-ners of the roof and then move the cross hair to the peak of the roof
and click there.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image011.jpg"></p>
<p>The Insert Array window shown below will open as you place the
second point and you may have to move it in order to place the third point.</p>
<p><img width=339 height=323
src="E2.files/image012.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that the program placed all 3 Vertices at -150 on the
Y-axis. Some of the other coordinate values are probably not entirely correct,
so change them to the correct figures shown below. The only thing left is to
tell the program how many Vertices we want in the arc. Eleven is the correct
number, as eleven is the number of Vertices in the edge of the existing dome.
Insert 11 in the <i>Items to Insert</i> field and hit <i>OK</i> to add the
Vertices. You'll probably have to switch to the 3D view to see them.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=671 height=329
src="E2.files/image013.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, we can add the Faces. Select the <i>Insert Face [F]</i>
button in the tool bar section and add the Faces one by one. Be sure to watch
the Face orientation as they are added. If incorrect, use the Invert button in
the tool bar section. Don't forget to include Vertex P3 in the side walls and
Vertex P2 in the end wall. When all the Faces are added, the room should look
like this.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image014.jpg"></p>
<p>We chose this method of entering the end wall and the roof to
illustrate the technique and use of the Create Circular Array/Vertices feature.
There is, however, a far easier and faster way to create the end wall and roof.
It's the Extrude feature. We would have added an end wall Face to the model so
we could Extrude it and instantly create in one simple step all the walls and
ceiling sections we just finished putting in one by one. After the extrusion,
the end wall Face we created so we could Extrude it would have to be deleted,
but that's easy to do. We also would have an extra floor Face in the area we
extruded which would have to be deleted. Nevertheless, the Extrude method would
would have been easier and much faster.</p>
<p>If you haven't been saving your work regularly while you created
this model, now would be a good time to do so. Just hit <i>F6</i>.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Quitting The Symmetrical Modeling Mode</b></p>
<p>The next major step is to add the side entrance to the room and
its two support columns. Refer to the drawing on page 89 if you have for-gotten
what the completed room looks like. So far, we have been working in the symmetrical
mode. We now need to change this as the side entrance is on just one side of
the structure.</p>
<p>It is important to note that once you have left the symmetrical
mode you shouldn't try to return. To show you what happens, go to the <i>Show</i>
<i>Vertex Table (</i>click on the Vertex Table icon) to see how many Vertices
are being used. The number, if you have done everything correctly,<i> </i>is 34
which does not count the mirrored (*) Vertices. Next, close the Vertice Table
and pick one of the mirror image Vertices, P3* for exam-ple.</p>
<p>Now right click on the screen to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Room
Data</i>. Then change the editing mode from Symmetrical to non-symmetrical by
clicking on the <i>Room Symmetric</i> box. Click on <i>OK</i> to initiate the
change. Now if you go back to the <i>Show Vertex Table</i>; you will see that
59 Vertices are listed. You will also note that the P3* Vertex selected is now
designated P36. The numbers of all the mirrored Vertices were changed. The same
holds true for all the Mirrored Faces. They, too, were renumbered.</p>
<p>What happens if you try to go back to the symmetrical modeling
mode is that EASE puts in mirror images of all the existing Vertices and Faces.
You end up with 2 of everything. This is why you shouldn't try to go back.</p>
<p><b>Cutting a Face Into Two Parts (Using Fixed Cut)</b></p>
<p>Now, it's time to add the side entrance. What we need to do is
cut Face F26 (your drawing may show different Face and Vertex numbers) in half
and build the entrance hall out from the right hand section. To do this we need
another Vertex, one at the top of the Face directly above P36. We could add
this Vertex using Duplicate/Displace. However, using this approach would mean
that we would also have to blow away Face F26 and the roof section directly
above it, and then enter 3 new Faces. This is not difficult to do, but it's not
the easiest way.</p>
<p>An easier way is to use the Vertex On Face Margin and Fixed Cut
features of EASE.</p>
<p>Select Face F26 (it could be another number in your model if you
didn’t exactly follow the Tutorial instructions), then right click to open the
Mouse menu and select <i>Vertex On Face Margin</i>. The cursor will now change
to cross-hairs; center them on the edge of Face F26 above P36 and click to
insert a Vertex (P60) into the edge or margin of the Face at that point.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the program will automatically also
insert Vertex P60 into the roof section Face above Face F20. Next, select
Vertex P60 and open its Property sheet to adjust its position. It should be
placed at -75 on the Y axis.</p>
<p>The next step is to use the Fixed Cut function to cut the Face
into half. Select <i>Fixed Cut</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and
then click on Vertices P60 and P36. This will divide the Face into two parts at
that location.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image015.jpg"></p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>We'll use the Extrude function of EASE to complete the entrance.
Pick Face F26 (it could be an other number in your model) and use the Mouse
menu to select Extrude and open the Extrude Displacement dialog box. Enter 90 in
the <i>x:</i> field and then hit <i>OK</i> and EASE will build (extrude) Face
F26 outward 90 feet to construct the entrance.</p>
<p><img width=665 height=301
src="E2.files/image016.jpg"></p>
<p>In one simple operation you have eliminated the need to
individually enter 5 Faces; the EASE Extrude feature did it for you.</p>
<p>We no longer need Face F26 (in fact, it's actually blocking the
entrance way), so blow it away by selecting it and hitting the <i>Delete</i>
key.</p>
<p>Now, would also be a good time to check the orientation of the
entrance way Faces. One way is to Pick them one by one and if they are
in-correctly oriented, use the Invert button in the Tool Bar section or the
Mouse menu to individually turn them around. You will probably find they are
all incorrectly oriented.</p>
<p>We could have avoided this by first inverting the Face being
Extruded. It, the Face being Extruded needed to have its exposed (reflective)
surface facing the direction of the extrusion.</p>
<p>Note that we extruded the entrance way from a Face that was
perpendicular to the Y axis, so all we had to do was extrude it 90 Ft. along
the X axis. If we had placed the entrance way on one of the angled walls, and
wanted it to be perpendicular to the wall, we would have en-tered 90 inthe
Distance field, checked <i>Align to First Face and</i> pressed the <i>Face
Normal Direction</i> option offered by the Extrude function.</p>
<p>Selecting this option would have told the program that we wanted
the entrance way to be at right angles (perpendicular) to the selected Face.
Extrude would then have calculated the correct extrusion angles.</p>
<p>The EASE Extrude function is a powerful modeling tool and one
that you should get to know well. It can save you hours of modeling time once
you become familiar with it and what it can do.</p>
<p>We'll practice with it again in the next exercise.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Adding Interior Shapes</b></p>
<p>Next, we'll add the two entrance way columns. The two columns
are placed 30 feet apart on the center line of the entrance.</p>
<p>Open the <i>Create Shape 3D</i> menu under the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Cylinder</i>. The correct parameters are shown in
the left Dis-placement dialog box shown below. The parameters for the second
column are shown in the right Displacement dialog box.</p>
<p><img width=163 height=278
src="E2.files/image017.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=163 height=280
src="E2.files/image018.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that both <i>With Floor</i> and <i>With Ceiling</i> show
Yes in their Value field and that <i>Hollow Polyhedron</i> shows No. In this
case, we don't want a Hollow Polyhedron as we want the reflective Faces looking
out into the room. We said Yes to <i>With Ceiling</i> and <i>With Floor</i> to
allow EASE to insert these Faces into the entryway floor and ceiling without
creating Holes.</p>
<p>Now go back to <i>Create Shape 3D/Cylinder</i> and put in the
parameters for the second column. Note that EASE makes this easy by picking up
the parameters from the previous Cylinder. All you need to do is change the <i>Center
x</i> location. The screen on the right above has the correct settings.</p>
<p>Be aware that this will throw off the room surface area
calculations slightly unless you also Coat the top Faces of the columns to the
ceiling Face and the bottom Faces to the floor Face. This will tell the program
to subtract the surface area of these Faces from the overall surface area. You
do not need to turn the top and bottom Faces into 2-Fold Faces.</p>

<p><b>Using Extrude Faces</b></p>
<p>Before we move on, let's explore another use of Extrude.</p>
<p>Let's place a floor to ceiling column inside the main room where
the ceiling slopes and the coordinates are unknown..</p>
<p>Open the <i>Create Shape 3D/Cylinder</i> window again and change
the <i>Center [ft] x</i> coordinate to 130 and the <i>Height</i> to 0. We only
want to put in the base of the column at this time. <i>OK</i> the insertion.</p>
<p><img width=163 height=278
src="E2.files/image020.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=157 height=257
src="E2.files/image021.jpg"></p>
<p>Then select the Face we just inserted, right click and select <i>Extrude</i>.
Note that you probably will have to Zoom In on it in order to select it.</p>
<p>We want to extrude the Face in the + z direction, so enter 1 in
the <i>Height [ft]dz</i> field.. EASE needs to know what direction to extrude
the Face.</p>
<p>Then, open the <i>Options</i> section of the Displacement window
and put a check in <i>Extrude to Next Face</i>.</p>
<p>Hit <i>OK</i> and the program will extrude the column base to
the ceiling and place the top of the column in the slanted ceiling Face.</p>

<p><b>Adding Doors and Windows</b></p>
<p>Now it’s time to add the entrance-way door to our model. The
door will be centered in the entrance way and will be 30’ wide and 24’ high.</p>
<p><img width=155 height=170
src="E2.files/image023.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Using Coat Feature</b></p>
<p><img width=223 height=154
src="E2.files/image024.jpg"></p>
<p>We know from an earlier exercise that the easy way to do this is
to Coat a two-fold Face onto the entrance-way wall. All you need to do is
insert a Vertice at x = 240, y = -22.5, Z = 0 and then ex-trude it 24’ up and
-30’ in the y direction to create the Face representing the door. Then use the
Properties folder to turn it into a Two-Fold Face and Coat it onto the wall
Face. It’s a simple 3-step procedure.</p>
<p><b>By Modeling into a Wall</b></p>
<p>Let’s explore what would be required if, for some reason, we
didn’t want to use the Coat feature.</p>
<p>Then we would have to model the door into the Face. This would
entail creating the door Face, blowing away the existing entrance-way wall
Face, and redrawing it, a more complicated procedure.</p>
<p>The steps would be:</p>
<p>1. Select the entrance-way Face and use the <i>Vertex on Face
Margin</i> procedure to place a Vertice (one of the lower corners of the door)
in the edge of the entrance-way wall Face.</p>
<p>2. Use <i>Vertex on Face Margin</i> to place the other lower
corner of the door in the edge of the entrance-way wall Face.</p>
<p>Note: If we did not use the Vertex on Face Margin to place these
two Vertices, we would also have to eventually blow away the en-trance-way
floor face and redraw it.</p>
<p>3. Use <i>Duplicate/Displac</i>e to put in the two Vertices
representing the top of the door.</p>
<p>4. Use <i>Insert Face</i> to create the door Face.</p>
<p>5 Blow away the entrance way wall Face and re-enter the wall
Face to include the 4 door Vertices. Remember. EASE wants all Ver-tices that
lie on the edge of a Face to be included in the Face.</p>

<p><b>Using Sequence</b></p>
<p><img width=275 height=248
src="E2.files/image026.jpg"></p>
<p>Our next exercise will be to add two 60' by 30' windows to the
flat face of the structure using the Sequence feature. We will put the windows
20' above the floor and space them 120' apart. Open the Insert pull down menu
and select Sequence. This will open the screen shown below.</p>
<p>Note that Sequence can be used to insert Vertices, Seats and
Loud-speakers, as well as several other items. We will be inserting Vertices.
The first step is to locate the first Vertex by inserting its x, y, z
coordi-nates into the dx, dy and dz fields. Insert 120, -150, 20. Then press
the Next button</p>
<p>Note that the coordinates you inserted now appear in the Last
Waypoint section. The window is 60' wide, so we want to place the next Vertex
60' closer to the y-axis. Insert -60 into the dx field and then hit <i>Next</i>.
The third Vertex needs to be placed 120' feet from the last one, so enter -120
into the dx field, hit the <i>Next</i> button and insert -60 for the 4th Vertex
lo-cation. Note that the locations of the new Waypoints you are entering are
relative to the location of the previous Waypoint.</p>
<p><img width=275 height=248
src="E2.files/image027.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, <i>OK</i> the Vertex sequence and EASE will place the
four Vertices in their right location.</p>
<p>The bottom Vertices are now in place. To add the top Vertices,
repeat the steps given above, except change the dz coordinate by 30. Remem-ber,
the windows are 30' high. As you can see, this feature allows you to insert a
number of irregularly spaced items quickly and easily.</p>
<p>All that remains is to create the window Faces and Coat them
onto the wall Face. Use the Insert Face [F] icon in the tool bar to add the
Faces. Don't forget to identify them as two-Fold Faces and to Coat them onto
the wall Face.</p>

<p><img width=671 height=340
src="E2.files/image029.jpg"></p>
<p>As I'm sure you realize, these windows could just as easily been
created with the Duplicate and Displace technique we used to add win-dows to
the Tutorial room (reference page 78). We used Sequence in this exercise merely
to demonstrate the technique. Also note that if the Vertices had been evenly
spaced, we would have used <i>Insert Line Array</i> , instead of Sequence.
We'll practice using the Insert Line Array feature a little later.</p>
<p><b>Using Insert Audience Area</b></p>
<p>The next step is to add an Audience Area to our building using
the <i>Insert Audience Area</i> command and the graphic modeling capabilities
of EASE. First, we will need to set the level for the Audience Area plane. Use
the right Mouse button to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Options [F9] </i>and
then open the<i> Editing </i>window. Change to the<i> xy Plane </i>and set the<i>
Plane Value </i>(the height of the plane) to 3.94', the ap-proximate height of
a seated listener's ear.</p>
<p>Note that you could have more easily accomplished the same thing
using the <i>shift + z</i> command. It would have taken you directly to the z
(overhead) view.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Next select the <i>Insert Audience Area [A]</i> tool and
graphically insert the Audience Area by placing its four corners at their
approximate loca-tion. As soon as the fourth point is inserted, the dialog
window shown below will open giving you an opportunity to fine tune the size
and lo-cation of the Audience Area.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image031.jpg"></p>
<p>Click on OK and the Audience Area will be correctly added to the
model.</p>
<p><b>Adding Loudspeaker Grids</b></p>
<p>Now, lets add a distributed loudspeaker system to our room.
We'll put in a grid of overhead loudspeakers 30 feet above the floor on 30'
centers. First, open the Editing tab under Options (<i>F9</i> or right click on
the screen and select <i>Options</i> from the Mouse men) or go direct to the
Editing tab with <i>Shift + z</i> and change the <i>xy plane</i> level to 30'.
If you used <i>Shift + z</i> to open the Editing window you are now using the z
or overhead view of the room. If you didn't use Shift + z to reach the Editing
tab, switch to the Z view using the <i>Z (Plan View)</i> icon or the <i>z</i>
key command.</p>
<p>While in the Options folder, you may also want to turn on the
z-Grid to aid in placing the loudspeakers. Select the Grid tab and then check
z-Grid. Hit OK.</p>
<p>Open the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and select <i>Linear
Array/Loudspeakers</i>. Next, use the cursor to place the end points of the
first loud-speaker row at its approximate location. This will open the setup
window shown below. The Starting Point and End Point coordinates most like
won't be entirely correct, so insert the correct coordinates (see below). Then,
insert the number of loudspeakers desired, in our case 9. If you want the
loudspeakers identified (labeled) put a check in the Label box. Now, click <i>OK</i>
to insert the first row of loudspeakers.</p>

<p>Use the same procedure to insert the other four loudspeaker rows
and you are done in a minute or two. What you want to do is to de-crease the y
coordinate by 30 for each row of loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Your room should now look like the one shown below.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image034.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, Pick one of the loudspeakers and right click to open the
Mouse menu and then select <i>Change All Same</i>. This will open a Choose
Speaker window and allow you to quickly select the loudspeaker you want to use
and change all the loudspeakers to that model. Note that you can also
accomplish the same thing with the <i>Ctrl + F3</i> key command.</p>
<p>At this point, all the loudspeakers are probably aimed down the
Y-axis instead of being pointed down at the floor. Verify this by picking one
of the loudspeakers, opening its Properties folder and turning On Show dB Cov
Cone.</p>
<p>You need to change the Vertical Angle of each loudspeaker to
-90.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>There are several ways to do this.</p>
<p><img width=177 height=281
src="E2.files/image035.jpg"></p>
<p>One is go to the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and select <i>Move
Loudspeaker</i> <i>Group</i>. This will open a selection window. Select all the
Loudspeakers in<i> </i>the first row and hit <i>OK</i>. This will turn all the
Loudspeakers in that row ”Active” and open a <i>Move Active Items</i> window.
Insert -90 in the <i>d Ver</i> field and press the <i>Go To Finger</i> icon.
This will re-aim all the loudspeakers in that row. Then follow the same
procedure for the other four rows. Note that you must do each row individually.</p>
<p>You can also use the Loudspeaker Table. Open it and select all
the loud-speakers using the Left Mouse button and the Shift key.</p>
<p><img width=636 height=318
src="E2.files/image036.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=636 height=318
src="E2.files/image037.jpg"></p>
<p>Then go to the Tools pull down menu and select <i>Set Value To</i>.
This will open a Select Value window. Select <i>Ver[o]</i> and hit <i>OK</i>.
This will introduce a prompt asking for the value, insert -90 and <i>OK</i>.
Exit the Loudspeaker Table and check the loudspeaker aiming. You'll see that
all of them have been re-aimed. It goes quickly.</p>
<p><img width=314 height=135
src="E2.files/image038.jpg"></p>
<p>Hint: Another way to quickly insert a number of loudspeakers and
a way employed by many users is to insert one loudspeaker, set its aiming and
other properties including the power level correctly, and then use the
Du-plicate/Displace and Repeat features to add and locate all the other
loud-speakers. With this technique, all loudspeakers will be properly set up
and aimed correctly when they are inserted.</p>

<p><b>Adding Steps / Bleachers</b></p>
<p>Our final exercise in the Circus project will be to add
bleachers along one wall. Let's make them 140' long and start them 6.5' from
the end wall. We'll let them come 15 feet out into the room and assume that
each seat is 18 inches deep and 18 inches above the previous seat. For the
moment, let's also assume the seats have no backs.</p>
<p>Amazingly, we only need to know the x, y, z coordinates for one
Vertex to construct the bleachers. These are needed to locate the first Vertex
after it has been inserted using the Insert Vertex [v] con. Then, its a simple
matter of using the Duplicate/Displace function to add the other three Vertices
that define the first row of seats and to create the Face. Duplicate/Displace
and Repeat can then be used to make additional rows of seats.</p>
<p><img width=120 height=252
src="E2.files/image039.jpg"></p>
<p>Use -135, -143.5, 1.5 as the coordinates for the first Vertex.
Then Duplicate it and Displace (move) it 1.5 ' closer to the wall (-1.5). Then
Duplicate/Displace it 140' along the Y axis; then Duplicate/Displace this
Vertex 1.5' away from the wall. Make a mental note of the Vertices P numbers as
you put them in.</p>
<p>Use the Insert Face [f] button to make the Face representing the
first row of seats. Make sure you identify it as a Two-Fold Face. It is
suspended in the room (not touching any wall or floor surfaces, so it needs to
be a Two-Fold Face.</p>
<p>You may run into problems putting in this Face using the Insert
Face tool, because the Vertices at the ends of the Face are so close together
on the screen that it's hard to pick the right one. At other times, the program
will have difficulty telling which of the Vertices you want to select. When
this happens, a prompt asking you to choose between two or more Vertice numbers
will appear. Make the choice and click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Using the Zoom key commands (F11 &amp; F12) or the Ctrl + Arrow
keys to zoom in on the Vertices will help make this process easier and faster.</p>
<p>A way to get around this is to use the <i>New Item</i> icon in
the tool bar. Clicking on it produces a Select Item dialog box asking what you
wish to create. Choosing Face and clicking OK will produce another dialog box
asking if you want to create a new Face. Answer Yes and the Properties window
for a new Face will appear. . Use the Change button and the Choose Vertex
window to one-by-one change the default Vertices listed to the ones defining
the Face you are adding and click on OK to create the Face. It only takes a few
seconds.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>After the Face that represents the first row of seats is
created, right click on the Face to bring up the Mouse menu, select <i>Duplicate</i>.
When the Displacement screen appears, displace this Face up 1.5' and back 1.5'
(displace Z by 1.5 and X by -1.5. Then, insert 8 into the Repeated field.</p>
<p><img width=150 height=163
src="E2.files/image041.jpg"></p>
<p>Clicking on <i>OK</i> will then automatically Duplicate and
Displace the Face 8 times. The result appears below. The bleachers, of course,
have no seat backs and appear to be suspended in space which,of course, they
are.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image042.jpg"></p>
<p>If you don’t like this illusion or if you want to dress up the
drawing, use the <i>Insert Edge [e]</i> icon to tie the ends of the seats
together and to put in a base. (Note that you'll need to add Vertices at the
intersection of the wall and the floor to outline the base.)</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image043.jpg"></p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Putting in these Edges will not alter the Room characteristics;
it just dresses up the drawing and makes it look like the seats have backs.</p>
<p>Remember, in EASE, Edges have no acoustical properties.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image044.jpg"></p>
<p>If the seats have backs, adding backs to them is as easy as it
was to put in the seats. Select the <i>Insert Face [f]</i> icon and then click
on the four Vertices that outline the space between the first and second row of
seats to insert the first seat back. Then select this Face and right click to
bring up the Mouse menu, select Duplicate. When the Displacement screen appears,
displace this Face up 1.5' and back 1.5' (change X by -1.5 and Z by 1.5). Then,
insert 8 into the Repeated field. This will Duplicate and Displace the Face 8
times.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image045.jpg"></p>
<p>The Duplicate/Displace technique we used produces
&quot;stacked&quot; Vertices. If you take a close look at the bleacher Vertices
by Picking them, you'll notice that there are two Vertices &quot;stacked&quot;
on top of each other at most points. Key command <i>Ctrl + F12</i> will fix
this problem. Try it and see what happens.</p>
<p>Note that if these bleachers were made from concrete or
otherwise enclosed, we would have needed to use single sided Faces and mod-eled
the bleachers into the wall and floor.</p>

<p><b>Using Prototype Rooms</b></p>
<p>Many of the rooms you will be modeling will fit into a
relatively few basic categories. EASE provides a library of basic room
Prototypes that can be quickly modified into close approximations of actual
rooms. In many cases, using these Prototype rooms can dramatically speed up the
room-modeling process. Drawings of the 33 different Prototype rooms included in
EASE are at the end of this section. Please take a few minutes to familiarize
yourself with the variety of models available.</p>
<p>There are two ways to access the Prototypes. The first is to
access them from the Insert pull down menu while in the Edit Project mode.</p>
<p>The other way is from the Desktop. We'll go through the Edit
Project approach first.</p>
<p>Earlier we decided that Church (A) was similar to the Tutorial
room we were building, so we'll use the Church (A) Prototype in this exercise.
We'll call it Church(A) and store it in its own folder, instead of in the
Tutorial folder as we have in the past. From the Main <i>File</i> pull down
menu choose <i>New Project</i> and type Church(A) in both the <i>Hall</i> and
the <i>Project File Name</i> fields and then click on <i>Create</i>. Answer <i>OK</i>
to the Project Path prompt that appears.</p>
<p><img width=301 height=114
src="E2.files/image046.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, open <i>Room Info/Data</i> under the <i>View</i> pull down
menu and enter Church(A) in the <i>Project Version</i> field.</p>
<p><img width=153 height=208
src="E2.files/image047.jpg"></p>
<p>Then open the Edit Project module (<i>Project Data</i> under the
<i>Edit</i> pull down menu). When the Edit Project module opens, select <i>Load
Prototypes</i> from the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu. This will open the Load
Proto-type menu and an outline drawing of the Amphitheater Prototype.</p>
<p>Use the drop down listing (click on the Down Arrow button) to
locate and select <i>Church (A)</i>. Then press the <i>Assemble Room</i>
button. A Replace Actual Prototype prompt will appear; answer <i>Yes</i>. This
will open the dimensional table for Church (A) and an outline drawing of the
room.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image048.jpg"></p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>If we had used the Desktop method of reaching the Prototypes, we
would have bypassed the first Load Prototype screen. From the Main screen we
would have selected <i>Start Working</i>, then clicked on <i>Create Project</i>
and when the Prototype icons appeared selected <i>Church (A)</i> by double
clicking on it. This would have opened the Project Options window with Church
(A) already inserted in the Hall and Project File Name fields. Clicking on <i>Create</i>
would then have opened the dimensional table for Church (A) and the outline
drawing of the Church(A) prototype.</p>
<p>Notice that selecting one of the dimension blocks, such as <i>Height</i>,
highlights that item in the drawing to prevent you from changing the wrong
dimension.</p>
<p><img width=435 height=326
src="E2.files/image049.jpg"></p>
<p>Change the dimensions to match the dimensions of our Model_1
room. Remember it was 75 Feet long, 50 feet wide, 12 feet to to top of the
walls and the peak was at 25 feet. The Chancel area (stage) was elevated two
feet and there were two 1 foot steps. You can at any time during this process
view on the screen any changes you have made by hitting <i>Apply</i>. Change
the initial dimensions to match our Model_1 dimensions and then click on <i>Apply</i>
and <i>OK</i>. This will convert the Prototype into a working EASE model</p>
<p><img width=435 height=326
src="E2.files/image050.jpg"></p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>There are 3 notable differences between this room and the
Model_1 room we created; The end walls are made of only one Face (instead of
being two separate Faces), there are no steps leading up to the Chancel area
and the seating areas are not defined. All can be easily corrected.</p>
<p>Use <i>Fixed Cut</i> to divide each of the end Faces into two
parts (select <i>Fixed Cut</i> from the <i>Tool</i>s pull down menu and then
click on the two Vertices at the top of the wall).</p>
<p>Adding the steps is a little more complicated. First, blow away
(delete) the Main Floor and the Wall Faces. Then, use Vertice on Face Mar-gin
to add two Vertices to the front of the 2 foot high Chancel Face and use Fixed
Cut to cut the Face into two 1 foot high Faces. Extrude the bottom face 1 foot
forward (in the -y direction) and then delete the three unneeded faces formed
during the extrusion. The final step is to re-enter the Main Floor and Side
Wall Faces. You will be surprised how little time it takes.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image051.jpg"></p>
<p>The Seating Areas can be added using the Coat feature just as
you did in the Model_1 exercise.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that the default Wall Material for prototype Faces
is Absorber and this needs to be changed to the correct wall materials.
Oth-erwise very bit of sound that strikes a surface will be immediately
absorbed and there will be no reflections. EASE cannot calculate RT times for a
room with no reflections as there is no reverberation.</p>
<p>Most rooms have one material that is dominate, i.e., used on
most of the Faces. With that in mind, Pick one of the Faces with the dominate
material and then right click to open the Mouse menu. Select <i>Change All Same</i>
and change the wall material on all of the Faces to the dominate material and
then individually change the remaining Faces.</p>

<p><b>Using Objects</b></p>
<p>One of the most useful EASE modeling features is the ability to
group together a number of items (Vertices, Faces, Edges, Speakers, etc.) into
a single item or Object as its called by the program. Objects can be created
from items of different types and can then be duplicated, moved and saved as an
Object for use in other models.</p>
<p>Let's start our investigation of Objects by creating a new
project. This time we'll use the Desktop Icons and Prototypes to quickly create
a new model. From the opening window, double click on <i>Start Working</i>,
then select <i>Create Projec</i>t and <i>Church(A</i>). We'll call our new
project Church_2 and put it in the Tutorial folder. When the Project Options
screen opens insert Tutorial in the <i>Hall</i> field and Church2 in the <i>Project</i>
<i>File Name </i>field and then click on<i> Creat</i>e.</p>
<p>Our model will be similar to the prototype Church(A), except for
having a height of 60', width of 60', length of 120' and five 2' by 1' wooden
beams (rafters) on 20' centers. When the Prototype screen opens, change the
dimensions to show a total Height of 60 feet, Breadth (width) of 60 feet and
Length of 103.6 feet (the stage is 16.4 feet deep). Hit <i>Apply</i> and then <i>OK</i>.
Then return to the Main window and go to <i>Room Info/Data </i>under the<i>
View </i>pull down menu; enter Church_2 in the<i> Project Version </i>field and<i>
OK</i>. Then open the Edit Project module.<i> </i>See how quick and easy it is
to build a working model.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image085.jpg"></p>
<p>We'll use Duplicate/Displace to put in the first beam. Select
one of the corner Vertices at the top of the rear wall (P6* for example) and
Du-plicate/Displace it by 20' along the x axis (displace it 20 in the y field).
Then Extrude the new Vertice 1 in the y direction and -2 in the the z direction
to Extrude the Face representing the end of the beam.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292

<p>122</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to extrude the Face you just created -30 in the
X direction to create the beam.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image087.jpg"></p>
<p>Now Displace the center Face by 43.60 in the z direction (the
roof peak is at 60 feet and the top of the beam at 16.4 feet, the height of the
wall). It’s that simple.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image088.jpg"></p>
<p>Hint: If you had forgotten the height of the roof peak or the
height of the wall, select one of the appropriate Vertices and read the z
coordi-nate from the status bar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>The next step is to turn the beam into an Object that can be
easily duplicated and moved. There are three ways to do this:</p>
<p><i>1. Activate </i>all the items you want included
in the Object and then use<i> Create Object </i>under the<i> Insert </i>Pull
down menu to turn them into<i> </i>an Object.</p>
<p>2. Open <i>Create Objec</i>t and use the Magic Wand to select
the items and add them to a list of items to be included in the Object.</p>
<p>3. Open <i>Create Object</i> and use the Item Tables to
select and add the desired items to the list of items to be included.</p>
<p>Note that Objects can also be created while Extruding an item.
We’ll practice that, too. We’ll try all of these methods, starting with the Add
Active Items approach.</p>

<p>Use your Mouse and individually Pick (select) all the items that
will be included in the Object; select an item using the Pick Tool and then
right click to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Activate</i> or use the <i>F8</i>
key command. Repeat the procedure until all of the items that will be included
in the Object have been Activated. Notice that you must individually Activate
each item. EASE will not automatically Activate mir-ror image items. Then
select <i>Create Objec</i>t from the <i>Inser</i>t pull down menu to open the
dialog box shown below.</p>
<p><img width=457 height=455
src="E2.files/image089.jpg"></p>
<p>Answering <i>Yes</i> will open the Edit Object win-dow shown to
the right. Notice that under Items it shows all the Vertices included in the
Faces we turned Active. If you aren’t sure of this click on the Faces radio
button and the items listing will change to show the Faces in-cluded in the
Image.</p>
<p>Notice that this window also gives you the op-portunity to name
(Label) the Object and in-clude a description.</p>
<p>The Add Active, Add Picked, and Add Faces buttons are used to
add an item to the list.</p>
<p>The Edit tab opens a new window which gives you the opportunity
to change the Wall Materials used in the Object, their color when viewed in the
Eyes module and their Texture in Vision.</p>
<p><img width=410 height=328
src="E2.files/image090.jpg"></p>
<p>The Axis tab allows you to set the Point Of Origin (insertion
point) for the Object.</p>
<p>Be aware that if you aren’t sure where to place the Point Of
Origin, you can use Apply to check out its location in the room model and then
change the Point Of Origin if you don’t like it. The Object symbol lets you
know where it is located.</p>
<p>Clicking on <i>OK</i> will turn the selected items into an
Object. See next page.</p>
<p>Note: You will not be able to see the Object symbol unless <i>Objects</i>
is checked under the <i>Items </i>pull down menu</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>Notice that the only change in the Room drawing is the addition
of the Object symbol.</p>
<p><img width=506 height=316
src="E2.files/image091.jpg"></p>
<p>The big difference is that the Object can be treated as a single
item and Duplicated, Displaced, Moved and Saved As an Object and filed away for
use in another project. The individual items in the Object retain their
original identities and can be modified.</p>
<p>Now that we have the Object created the rest is a snap. Select the
Object, use the right mouse button to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Duplicate</i>.
When the Displacement dialog box opens, insert 20 in the<i> </i><u>y</u><i> </i>field
and 4 in the<i> Repeated </i>field. Then press<i> OK </i>to add 4 more<i> </i>beams
in their correct location.</p>
<p><img width=506 height=316
src="E2.files/image092.jpg"></p>
<p>This would be a good time to check the Room for Holes. Go to <i>Room
Data</i> (right click on screen and then select <i>Room Data</i>) and make sure
<i>Room Open</i> isn’t checked. The Room needs to be closed before you check
for holes. Then select <i>Check Holes</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu
and anticipate the Well Done prompt.</p>

<p>The second method of creating an Object is the Magic Wand. To
explore this method, open Create Objects under the Insert pull down menu, only
this time answer <i>No</i> to the Assign Active Items prompt. This will open
the Edit Object window. Select the Wand and then return to the Edit Project
screen and use the Wand and the left Mouse button to individually select the
desired items (Faces). Then right click on the selected item to add it to the
Object. A musical tone will tell you that the item has been added successfully.</p>
<p>You may want to minimize the Edit Object window while using the
Wand to select items. If you do, restore the Edit Object window after you have
finished selecting the items, define the Point of Origin and click on <i>OK</i>
to create the Object.</p>
<p>The third method of creating an Object make use of the project’s
Item Tables. To explore this method, open <i>Create Object</i> under the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu and then cancel the Use Active Items Prompt when it opens. When
the Edit Object screen opens, select the Items tab, if it isn’t already
selected, and choose one of the items listed, Faces for example.</p>
<p>Then press the <i>Select</i> button to open a listing of all the
Faces in the project. Now, all you need to do is select the Faces you want
included in the Object. If you don't know the Face numbers, return to the Edit
Project window, turn on the Face Labels and make note of their num-bers. Then
return to the Edit Object window and select/add them to the Object. Hint: To
select multiple items hold down the <i>Ctrl</i> key while using the left mouse
button to select them one by one.</p>
<p><img width=361 height=289
src="E2.files/image093.jpg"></p>
<p>When you are finished selecting them, click on <i>OK</i> and
then on <i>OK</i> again to create the Object.</p>
<p><img width=157 height=299
src="E2.files/image094.jpg"></p>
<p>Objects can also be created directly from Create Shape 3D under
the Insert pull down menu. To see how this works, let's assume that our room
has large circular windows 4 feet in diameter in both end walls.</p>
<p>Go to <i>Create Shape 3D</i> and select <i>Cylinder.</i> When
the Create Shape screen opens, fill in the fields as shown. We're going to
place the window 30 feet above the floor in the rear wall.</p>
<p>Note that we listed the Height of the cylinder as 0 (we just
want a circular Face and not a cylinder) and put a check in the <i>Create
Object</i> box.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the program created an Object just where we wanted it.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image095.jpg"></p>
<p>The only problem is that it's not upright. Not a problem,
really. Use the right Mouse button to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Move</i>.
When the Move screen appears, use the <i>Aiming</i> section to rotate the
Object 90 degrees vertically. Now, the window is exactly where we want it.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image096.jpg"></p>
<p>But, it looks a little small. We must have been looking for a
window 8 feet in diameter and not 4 feet. Again, no problem. Use the Mouse menu
again and select <i>Scale</i>. Enter 2 into the field and hit <i>OK</i>. Now
the window is the correct size.</p>
<p>All that is left to do is to turn the window into a 2-Fold face
and Coat it onto the end wall.</p>
<p>Obviously, at this point we can use Duplicate/Displace to add a
second window and move it to the front wall</p>

<p>Create Objects is a powerful tool. With Create Objects and a
little imagination you can easily solve many of your modeling problems. You can
also use it to dress up your model. You can, for example, take a few minutes to
create a nice looking church pew as an Object and then save it and use it in
place of Listener Seats in all your future church models.</p>

<p><b>Packing a Project</b></p>
<p>Before we move on to Cluster Construction, let’s Pack the
project away for storage or shipment. Packed files are the best way to store
your old project files. They also are the best way to e-mail a project to an
associate.</p>
<p>Open the project you want to Pack and then select <i>Pack
Project</i> from the <i>File</i> pull down menu. This will open the familiar
Name and Desti-nation dialog window shown below. Verify or rename the project
and its storage location and then click on <i>Save.</i></p>
<p><img width=372 height=256
src="E2.files/image098.jpg"></p>
<p>Clicking on <i>Save</i> will open the Prompt shown below.
Answering <i>OK</i> will compress the Project file and store it away.</p>
