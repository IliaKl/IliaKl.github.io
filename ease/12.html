<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p>Auralization is the process of converting the acoustic and
electro-acoustic data generated by EASE into an audio signal that can be heard
and evaluated. It adds subjective listening to the evaluation process.</p>
<p>EARS is a Binaural Auralization program that take into account
both the acoustical properties of the room and the hearing characteristics of
the human head. Binaural auralizations are inherently more realistic than
Monaural auralizations, since Monaural auralizations do not take the
characteristics of human hearing into account.</p>
<p>EARS offers both “Off Line” and “On Line” (Real Time)
auralizations.</p>
<p>&quot;Off Line&quot; binaural auralization signals are produced
&quot;Off Line&quot; and then stored for later replay or listening. Since these
files are quite large, these auralizations are usually limited to relatively
short &quot;sound bites&quot; that are replayed again and again. Eighteen to
twenty second sound bites are typically used, but longer ones are possible.</p>
<p>“On Line” binaural auralizations use LAKE Convolution Filter
software to produce the auralization signal in a continuous or
&quot;ongoing&quot; man-ner that can be heard immediately in what amounts to
&quot;Real Time&quot;. Thus, they are usually referred to as RT auralizations.
Since the aural-izations are heard in &quot;Real Time&quot; and not stored,
there is no limit to their length.</p>
<p>Auralization is a step by step procedure that normally starts
with a Reflectogram created by EASE and ends with the listening experience.</p>
<p>The steps are:</p>
<p>Step 1: Creating the Reflectogram. The Reflectogram represents
the acoustical signature of the room at the point it was taken.</p>
<p>Step 2: Adding a Tail to the Reflectogram. The Tail extends the
Reflectogram and adds realism to the auralization. <b>Note that using</b> <b>AURA
to develop the Reflectogram eliminates this step as it automatically adds a
Tail to the Reflectogram.</b></p>
<p>Step 3: Combining the Reflectogram with the characteristics of
human hearing. This creates the Binaural signal used in the final con-volution.</p>
<p>Step 4: The final convolution and listening experience.</p>
<p><b><i>Step 1: Creating the Reflectogram.</i></b></p>
<p>Since the Reflectogram is the foundation upon which the
auralization is built, having a good one is essential to the production of
accurate, realistic auralizations.</p>
<p><b>Note: AURA with its advanced algorithms and ability to take
advantage of the reduced computing times offered by multi-core processors is
highly recommended for anyone using EARS. It allows the creation of
Reflectrograms with larger reflection orders and longer time windows than is
possible with the Ray Tracing and Mirror Image algorithms used by EASE. AURA
also automati-cally creates the “Tail”, eliminating the need for Step 2, Adding
a Tail to the Reflectogram. AURA also allows the effects of Scat-tering to be
included in the simulation; Ray Tracing and Mirror Image algorithms do not.</b></p>
<p>Ray Tracing Impact studies are the favorite of users who do not
have AURA, since they produce satisfactory Reflectograms in less time than
Mirror Image studies.</p>
<p>Mirror Image Impact studies produce more precise Reflectograms
than Ray Tracing Impacts. However, the longer computation times re-quired by
the Mirror Image method usually make its use impractical in large, complex
rooms.</p>
<p>A normal tendency while creating Reflectograms is to think that
the longer the Time Frame used, the better the results. This isn't necessar-ily
true. It certainly isn't true if the Reflection Order is too low and many of
the rays are cut off by the reflection count before they impact upon the
counting balloon, or if an inadequate number of rays are emitted into the room
to ensure a good study.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>A factor to consider when choosing the Time Frame is that in
most rooms statistical behavior of the reverberations takes over after 180 ms
to 250 ms have elapsed. After this occurs, impacts generated statistically by
adding a statistical &quot;Tail&quot; to the Reflectogram can be used.</p>
<p>Because of the calculation time involved, choose the location
and number of Listener Seats with care. Using a large number of Listener Seats
doesn't make sense unless each one is going to tell you something useful about
the room. You want locations that will provide you with useful simulations.</p>
<p>Because every room is different, there are no hard and fast
rules to generating good reflectograms. However, one way to tell when a
questionable one has been created is the reflection density. As a general rule,
the reflection density in a room increases with time. So, a decreasing density
toward the end of the Reflectogram indi-cates either the number of Rays was
insufficient or the Reflection Order was to low.</p>
<p><img width=330 height=322
src="E4.files/image055.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Computing Protoco</i>l screen that appears at the end of
the cal-culations is a good place to check this. Note that in our example the
Reflection Order count appears to be leveling off at the end, a sign that more
Rays or a higher Reflection Order should probably have been used.</p>
<p>A thinning (lower impact density) should not show up in the
Reflec-togram when you view it using the Probe. If it does, you probably should
rerun the Impact study with more Rays or a higher Reflec-tion Order</p>
<p>Additionally, and as we learned while studying Ray Tracing
Impacts in Advanced Room Investigation, the Ray Tracing Control window</p>
<p>can also be used to tell when a questionable Reflectogram is
being created. If you skipped this section of the Tutorial, please go back to
the Advanced Room Investigation section and review the pages on Ray Tracing
Impacts.</p>
<p>We’ll use the Reflectogram we created in our Ray Tracing Impact
study under Advance Room Investigations for our Auralization exercise. To get
started, open the <i>Ray Tracing</i> module, go to the <i>Rays</i> pull down
menu, select <i>View Impact File</i> and then open the <i>.mpc file</i> we
cre-ated. When the <i>View Impact File</i> dialog window opens, select <i>Invoke
Probe</i>. Be patient, it may take the program a minute or two to de-velop the
Reflectogram.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Step 2. Adding a Tail to the Reflectogram (if needed)</b></p>
<p>Note: AURA users do not need to add a Tail if the Response File
was created by AURA. AURA automatically adds the tail, including scat-tered
diffuse and reverberant sound.</p>
<p>In normal rooms the diffuse sound decay starts not later than
250 to 300 msec after direct sound, so Reflection orders of 12 to 15 should be
the maximun used and a statistical tail added to the reflectogram. Generally,
there is no Reflection Order limitation in EASE 4.3 (orders of 50 or more are
possible), only a memory question. The files can easily be 500 Mb or more and
difficult to handle. They also take a long time to calculate. Accordingly, most
users use shorter time frames and lower reflection orders and add a Tail.</p>
<p>There are two ways to add a Tail, <i>Add Random Tail</i> and <i>Add
Predicted Impacts</i>.</p>
<p><b>Adding a Tail with <i>Add Random Tail</i></b></p>
<p>Select <i>Add Random Tail</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down
menu. This will introduce the Reverberant Tail setup screen shown below. It
allows you to edit the Tail's characteristics. We'll be returning to this
screen soon to explore its use. So, for now, just click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p><img width=363 height=278
src="E4.files/image057.jpg"></p>
<p>A typical result is shown below.</p>
<p><img width=533 height=319
src="E4.files/image058.jpg"></p>
<p>258</p>
<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that the Tail appears to be a little lower in level than
the initial Reflectogram. The default parameters used to generate the Tail were
based on an average of the last 10 impacts and usually needs to be changed.</p>
<p>To correct this, estimate how much lower the level is in dB. You
can do this by using the Level scale on the right side of the Reflectogram or
by repeatedly clicking in the Reflectogram on each side of the Tails junction
with the original Reflectogram and using the dB readouts to estimate the level
difference.</p>
<p>Then return to the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu and select <i>Cut
Random Tail</i> to remove the Tail so you can add a new one.</p>
<p>Next, open the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu again and again select
<i>Add Random Tail</i>. This will open the Reverberant Tail setup window again.
Note that you can change the Tail's Start time, its Length, the Pulse Density,
amplitude variations (Amplitude Noise) and Level (Amplitude Gain).</p>
<p>Most editing of the Tail is done visually, The object is to
create a Tail that closely resembles the starting Reflectogram in density, in
level and in individual pulse variations (spikes and peaks).</p>
<p>To see how this works, change the <i>Amplitude Gain</i> by 10
dB, click on <i>OK</i> or <i>Recompute</i>. EASE will then add a new Random
Tail based on the new parameters. Now, use the Zoom feature to take a closer
look at the pulses on both sides of the junction.</p>
<p>Please repeat the <i>Cut Random Tail</i> and <i>Add Random Tail</i>
procedure until you are satisfied with the results. We ended with a Pulse
Density of 30,000, a 10 dB Gain Increase and a 30 dB Amplitude Noise increase.</p>
<p><img width=532 height=317
src="E4.files/image059.jpg"></p>
<p>As the final step, take a look at the Reflectogram at several
frequencies. What looks good at 1000 Hz may not look quite as good at 400 Hz or
4000 Hz. If this is the case, you may want to revise the Tail again to strike a
compromise that looks best for all frequencies.</p>
<p>When you are satisfied you can either save the result as a
Response File (a .rsp file) or go directly to the Auralization program and
create a Binaural Impulse Response File (a .bir File). If you decide to save
the edited Reflectogram as a Response File, open the <i>File</i> pull down
menu, select <i>Save Response File As</i> and follow the prompts.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Using Add Predicted Impacts</b></p>
<p>Add Predicted Impacts is another method of adding a random tail.
This method analyzes the decay behavior of the initial Reflectogram and
calculates values like Mirror Dimension, Impacts Present and Impacts Missing.
It is usable ony for short time reflectograms limited in re-sponse time length.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Add Predicted Impacts</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull
down menu introduces the set up screen shown below.</p>
<p><img width=342 height=273
src="E4.files/image060.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that you have the opportunity to enter a new response
length, including the Tail, for the Reflectogram. Let's use 1000 ms.</p>
<p>EASE can calculate the new number of impacts in two ways, one
with a limit to the Pulse Density and the other without a limit. We recom-mend
the default setting which is Limit Pulse Density. The file size can be huge if
the Pulse Density isn't limited.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>A good way to compare the two methods of generating a
Reverberant Tail is to calculate the Schroeder RT plots for both methods.</p>
<p>Open the <i>Options</i> menu (hit <i>F9</i>) for the Probe and
open the <i>Schroeder</i> tab. Accept the default settings and click on the <i>Compute</i>
button.</p>
<p>Then activate <i>Draw Schroeder Curve into Reflectogram</i> and
click on <i>Apply</i> or <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Schroeder plots for both the Random Tail and Predicted Impacts
methods follow. The Random Tail plot is the one on top.</p>
<p>Note that there is a difference in the projected RT time.</p>
<p><img width=521 height=621
src="E4.files/image062.jpg"></p>
<p>When you are satisfied you can either save the result as a
Response File (a .rsp file) or go directly to the Auralization program and
create a Binaural Impulse Response File (a .bir File). If you decide to save
the edited Reflectogram as a Response File, open the <i>File</i> pull down
menu, select <i>Save Response File As</i> and follow the prompts. Note that the
File pull down menu also allows you to save the Reflectogram as a .bir File.</p>

<p><b>Step 3. Combining the Reflectogram with the Characteristics of
Human Hearing</b></p>
<p>To go direct to the Auralization program, open the <i>Tools</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Invoke EARS</i>. The following prompt will appear.</p>
<p><img width=347 height=180
src="E4.files/image063.jpg"></p>
<p>Answering <i>Yes</i> will open a new window asking you to name
the Response File and designate its location. We suggest storing Response Files
with all the other project data, so all the files are in one location.</p>
<p>Approving the name and location by hitting <i>OK</i> will bring
up the Response File summary.</p>
<p><img width=488 height=367
src="E4.files/image064.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to create the Binaural Impulse Response File
that will be used in the auralization. During this operation, the discrete
pulses of the Monaural Response File will be convolved with the characteristics
of the human head to create a Binaural Response File (.bir). FFT (Fast Fourier
Transform) will be used for this. The convolution may take a minute ot two;
exactly how long depends on the size of the Response File and the speed of your
computer.</p>
<p>To start the process, select <i>Make Binaural Response File</i>
from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu.</p>
<p>This will open the Setup menu for the Binaural Impulse Response
(.bir) convolution shown on the next page.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=673 height=374
src="E4.files/image065.jpg"></p>
<p>Your first step should be to review the File name and location
set up for the Output BIR File. We suggest the same name and file location as
the Input RSP. It's nice to have both in the same location.</p>
<p>This menu also gives you the opportunity to turn the Dummy Head
and to choose the head Transfer Function (HRTF) that will be used.</p>
<p>Unless you have a specific reason to use one of the other heads,
we suggest you use the one titled Dummy Head.</p>
<p>The convolution will start when you click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>When the convolution is completed, a Show Filter Info prompt
will appear. Answer <i>Yes</i> and the Show Filter Info window shown below will
appear.</p>
<p><img width=407 height=305
src="E4.files/image066.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that separate Left and Right Ear files have been created.</p>
<p>263</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Step 4. The Final Convolution</b></p>
<p>Select <i>Auralization</i> from the EARS Module <i>Tools</i>
pull down menu. This will open the EARS Convolver window..</p>
<p><img width=432 height=298
src="E4.files/image067.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the .bir (Binaural Impulse Response) file we just
created was inserted into the FIR Filter (Finite Impulse Response) field.
Directly below the FIR Filter section is the Input Control section. This
section determines what signal will be used in the auralization. Clicking on
the <i>Disk </i>icon selects the CD Player as the signal source; the File
Folder icon allows you to browse to the dry audiosignal file you want to use in<i>
</i>the auralization. The default signal is the <i>Male Voice.wav</i> file. If
it doesn’t appear in the Input field, browse to it. You’ll find it stored in
the Dry Input Signal Files folder under Ease40Data.</p>
<p>The Output Control section determines the output signal type
that will be generated. Selecting the File Folder will save the signal as a .wav
file for later playback; the Headset icon sends the auralization to your
computer’s sound card for listening over stereo headsets or loud-speakers.</p>
<p>Before we go on, let's take another look at the Binaural
Response File. Open the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and select <i>Show Filter
Info Now</i> to view the file. Note: If your screen looks different than the
one above (the Convolver section on the right side isn't visible) and the <i>Tools</i>
pull down menu isn't active press the <i>Eject</i> button. This will expand the
window and activate the Tools pull down menu. Open it and select <i>Show Filter
Info Now</i>. This will open the Binaural Impulse Response File. Use your left
mouse button to double click on the graphic and<i> </i>view the frequency
representation of the .bir File shown below. Notice the different
characteristics.</p>
<p><img width=392 height=294

<p>264</p>
<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Close the Binaural Response File display and return to the EARS
Convolver window. Note the large <i>EARS</i> and <i>Lake Convolver</i> buttons.
These buttons determine the convolution method that will be used. The EARS
button selects the “offline” method which creates a file that can be stored and
replayed. The Lake button activates the “Online” or “Real Time” convolution
method. Both methods use FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for the convolution. The
difference between the two methods is that the RT convolution is ongoing.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the Offline EARS method. Pressing the EARS
button will select the EARS convolver (see below on the left).</p>
<p>The next step is to name the .Wav file that will be created by
the convolution. Select the <i>File</i> icon under <i>Outpu</i>t and insert the
file name and storage location and then <i>Save</i>. Then press <i>Eject</i>
and <i>Go</i>.</p>
<p>The convolution may take a little time, how much time depends
upon the size of the Binaural Response File (.bir) and the length of the .wav
file containing the dry audio signal. Then, EARS will automatically play the
auralization for you and open the control window shown below on the right to
make it easy for you to replay the auralization as many times as you want.</p>
<p><img width=511 height=230
src="E4.files/image069.jpg"></p>
<p>The vertical slide control adjusts the signal level being sent
to your Sound Card (actually the Windows Audio Mixer). When <i>Set Volume to</i>
<i>File Level </i>is activated, the program automatically adjusts the output
signal level to the .WAV file level. This allows you to listen to level<i> </i>variations
between auralizations made in different room locations.</p>
<p>The best way to listen to the Binaural auralizations produced by
EASE is through a pair of good loudspeakers. Place them 2 to 3 feet apart and
then sit directly in front of them at a listening angle of approximately 30
degrees. You want to be close to the loudspeakers to minimize the effect of the
listening room.</p>
<p>The use of loudspeakers introduces a certain amount of
loudspeaker &quot;cross-talk&quot; between the channels into the listening
experience. This can be eliminated by activating the XTC feature using the XTC
check box located under the Output section of the Ears Convolver window. This
introduces the VMax Virtual Home Theater surround sound software into the
playback. Try it. You'll hear the difference.</p>
<p>Note that the XTC feature is available only on EARS. It is not
available on EARS RT.</p>
<p>Stereo headsets can be used, but they aren't recommended because
of their well known loss of localization for on-axis signals. With stereo headsets,
you are unable to distinguish between on-axis signals arriving from the front
and rear.</p>

<p><b>EARS Options</b></p>
<p>The <i>Utility</i> pull down menu in the <i>Auralization</i>
window includes a number of useful options.</p>
<p><i>Keep To Auralize </i>and<i> Keep as Start Default </i>are
used to define the start up default<i> </i>settings. <i>Keep to Auralize</i> is
used with the <i>Auralize Direct Sound</i> feature in Standard Mapping, <i>Render
Mapping</i>, the <i>Walke</i>r and the <i>Probe</i>. It sets up the convolver's
input and output configurations. <i>Keep as Start Default</i> does the same for
auraliza-tions that are initiated from the EARS program module.</p>
<p><img width=194 height=232
src="E4.files/image070.jpg"></p>
<p><i>Silent When Clipping </i>is used with Online (Real Time)
auralizations to mute the out-put whenever the Lake convolver is driven into
clipping. More about this later.</p>
<p><i>Auto Foreground </i>keeps the Convolver window in
the foreground during Real Time<i> </i>auralizations. Unless it is turned on,
opening another window will mute the ongoing auralization.</p>
<p><i>Walker View Coupled </i>ties the Walker's position and
viewing angle together with the<i> </i>Filter file being used in the convolver.
This assumes that the Eyes program module is open.</p>
<p><i>FIR Info Coupled </i>connects the FIR Info Display
and the active FIR together, so the<i> </i>Info Display will automatically show
the current FIR filter characteristics.</p>
<p><i>Volume Coupled </i>is used only with Real Time

Time is greater than the Available Time, a larger Frame Size will have to be
used. If it’s smaller, a shorter time can probably be used.</p>
<p><img width=419 height=202
src="E4.files/image077.jpg"></p>
<p>In our case, we can use a smaller Frame Size. Use the Frame Size
arrows to select a smaller Frame Size and run <i>Compute All Times</i> again.
Note that any yellow numbers that appear in the windows indicate the
performance is marginal; any red numbers mean the setting is unusable.</p>
<p><img width=419 height=202
src="E4.files/image078.jpg"></p>
<p>One word of caution; our experience is that Frame Sizes less
than 1024 may lead to broken/chopped auralizations. As a result, Frame</p>
<p>Sizes smaller than 1024 are not recommended. Don't try to change
the Sampling Rate and the Response Length. As a new user of EARS</p>
<p>consider them as being fixed.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>When you have determined the proper Frame Size you want to use,
press <i>Exit</i>.</p>
<p>EARS does not transfer this setting to the Convolver, so the
next step is to select the correct Frame Size into the Convolver’s Frame field.</p>
<p>Use the drop down arrow.</p>
<p>Now make sure the Convolver Output is set up for Audio. If not,
press the <i>Headset</i> icon in the <i>Output</i> section. The next step is to
make sure the desired .bir (Binaural Impulse Response) filter or filters have
been installed in the FIR folder. For our demonstration, we also want to
install a Unity filter that will allow us to switch &quot;on the fly&quot;
between an auralized signal and an unauralized one. This allows us to compare
the two conditions. Open the Tools pull down menu and select Add Unity Filter.</p>
<p>We also suggest using the <i>Silent When Clipping</i> feature
during the auralization. It eliminates any clipping noise from the playback by
mut-ing the output signal. Open the <i>Utilities</i> pull down menu and click
on <i>Silent When Clipping</i>.</p>
<p>Now, we can select the input source driver. Return to the Main <i>EARS</i>
window and open the Tools pull down menu and select <i>CD Player</i>. Note that
you have two choice. <i>EARS</i> selects its own player; <i>Windows</i> selects
the Windows CD player. We will be using the Windows CD player, so select <i>Windows</i>.
Note that instead of a CD player signal we could also have used a dry *.wav
file.</p>

<p>Now, we are ready to go. Start the CD player, if it hasn't
already started, make sure <i>Convolve</i> is checked and then press <i>Install
Fir</i> (trans-late into insert the filter). This will activate the <i>Go</i>
button. Press it to start the convolution. The <i>Played</i> readout window
will signal that the convolution has begun by starting to display the elapsed
time.</p>
<p>At this point, signal levels and gain may not be set for optimum
operation. The Lake convolver expects proper gain settings for all its
Fil-ters. If the convolver gain setting are set too low, background noise can
easily become a problem. The best signal to noise ratios are ob-tained when the
gains are as high as possible. But, high gain settings introduce clipping.</p>
<p>EARS has the ability to determine the proper settings, but it
cannot do this without actually doing at least a short convolution. Press the <i>Stop
</i>and<i> Ejec</i>t buttons and then click on<i> Peak Gain </i>to inform the
program you want it to adjust the gain. Then, check<i> Silent When Clipping </i>under
the <i>Utilities</i> pull down menu.</p>
<p>Now, return to the auralization by clicking on <i>Install Fir</i>
and then pressing <i>Go</i>. Initially you may hear nothing or a convoluted
signal (you may have accidentally matched the correct settings) or a brief high
noise level. In the last case, the <i>Silent When Clipping</i> option kicked in
and eliminated the clipping noise.</p>
<p>In all cases it will take a few seconds, possibly as long as 30
seconds or more, for the program to determine the optimum settings based on the
selected sample rate and needed frame size.. Then you’ll hear the noise
disappear. Now press <i>Stop</i> and <i>Eject</i> again and then click on <i>Peak
Gain</i> to adjust the gain to its correct level. Next, return to the
auralization by clicking on <i>Install Fir</i> and then pressing <i>Go</i>.
Listen to the convoluted (auralized) result. Please note that if higher peaks
appear later on in the selection, the initial settings are no longer valid.</p>
<p>At this point you can save the gain settings by going to the <i>Tools</i>
pull down menu and selecting <i>Save FIR Gain</i>. To do this you will have to
stop the convolution and hit the <i>Eject</i> button. Selecting <i>Save FIR
Gain</i> will store the proper gain settings with the FIR file and they will be
called up automatically the next time you use this FIR file. One word of
caution; the gain settings apply only to the CD you have been play-ing and to
the track being played! If you change CD's or play a different track, you will
need to repeat the process.</p>
<p>Note that the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu also includes a <i>Save
All FIR Gains</i> command. This is used when you have a number of FIR files
from different locations within a model and you want to set and save the gain
settings that give you the best performance while maintaining rela-tive levels.
You need to establish the gain settings for each FIR File and then activate <i>Save
all FIR Gains</i>. The program will take it from there.</p>
<p>You can also manually adjust the Gain settings for the best
performance by inserting Gain figures into the <i>Convolver Gain</i> field and
adjust-ing the output level of your Windows Mixer. It takes a little experimenting,
but it's usually not too hard to find a combination of settings that complement
each other.</p>

<p><b>Real Time Stereo Convolver</b></p>
<p>EARS also includes a Real Time Stereo Convolver.</p>
<p>Both the normal EARS Convolver and the Lake convolution fil-ters
produce binaural auralizations from a monaural input sig-nal. The Stereo Convolver
produces a binaural auralization from a stereo input signal.</p>
<p>The R-System signal is used to produce a Right BIR and the
L-System signal used for a Left BIR and both BIR's are used in the final
convolution.</p>
<p>Notice that Stereo Convolver allows users to either save the
convolution to their hard drive as a .Wav file or play it in real time.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>Operation is quite simple. Select <i>Stereo Convolver</i> from
the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu. When the Stereo Convolver screen opens, choose
the Input signal (probably a stereo CD) and choose the Output signal (probably
Audio). Next use the <i>File</i> icon in the Filter section to select the Right
and Left BIR’s. Then press the <i>Go</i> button.</p>
