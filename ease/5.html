<p><b>Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p>It is now time to become familiar with the loudspeaker cluster
building capabilities within EASE 4.3. The associated SpeakerLab program which
also includes cluster building capabilities will be covered separately.</p>
<p>EASE 4.3 provides loudspeaker cluster construction facilities in
two locations; the Main Speaker Base module and the Edit Project (Room Editor)
module. The same algorithms are used in both modules, only the applications are
different.</p>
<p><b>Main SpeakerBase Cluster Module</b></p>
<p>The Main SpeakerBase module is mainly used to show, analyze and
investigate the performance of various loudspeaker array combi-nations in free space.
Then, if the performance is up to expectations, the array can be saved and
installed in projects just as if it was a single loudspeaker.</p>
<p><b>Edit Project Module</b></p>
<p>The Edit Project module allows Clusters to be built within the
project and saved as a Cluster. It also allows existing loudspeaker ar-rays,
including ones imported as part of an EASE 2.1 project to be converted into a
Cluster and treated as a single loudspeaker.</p>
<p>Multi-loudspeaker arrays (and Clusters) can also be turned into
an Object (a .fla loudspeaker array file) and saved for use in other projects.</p>
<p>We'll cover this approach later in this section.</p>
<p>All three methods allow you to save and store popular arrays so
you can reuse them in other projects without having to reconstruct them.</p>
<p><b><i>Note that the directivity balloons for
Clusters are calculated only for the Far Field. As a result, Clusters should
not be relied upon for Near Field investigations. For Near Field
investigations, clusters can and should be Exploded (turned back to their
orig-inal multi-cabinet status) and then regrouped into a Cluster after the
investigation.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Clusters can also be constructed in
SpeakerLab and turned into a GLL file. Clusters created in SpeakerLab provide
both accurate Near and Far Field calculations. For details go to Chapter 14:
SpeakerLab.</i></b></p>
<p>Treating Clusters as a single loudspeaker reduces calculation
times, especially in Ray Tracing. Computation times are directly proportional
to the number of loudspeakers (i.e., doubling the number of loudspeakers
doubles the computation time). Please note that the saving in computation times
is most significant in Ray Tracing investigations. The times required for
energy and intelligibility mapping are usually short and the time savings are
not as significant. The accuracy of the calculations is not affected by the use
of &quot;Clusters&quot; in the Far Field.</p>
<p>Multi-loudspeaker arrays saved as Objects in a *.fla file are
treated by EASE as multiple loudspeakers, allowing the program to correctly
calculate interference in both the Near and Far Fields. The computation time,
of course, is longer than the time required for &quot;Cluster&quot;
calcu-lations.</p>
<p>We'll start our Cluster exercise using the Main SpeakerBase
module. Return to the <i>Main</i> menu, open the <i>File</i> pull down menu and
select <i>Main Databases/Speaker Models/SpeakerBase</i>. This will open the
EASE Main SpeakerBase program module. Open the<i> File </i>pull down<i> </i>menu
and select <i>New Cluster</i>. Note that the Edit Cluster Speaker window that
opens is identical to the one we have used in Edit Project, except for some of
the tool buttons being inactive.</p>
<p>Our next step will be to set the Editing plane to make it easier
to insert the loudspeakers. Open the Options window by pressing the <i>Op-tions
[F9] </i>icon in the tool bar section, select the<i> Editing </i>tab, the
xy-plane and set the<i> Plane Value </i>to 0.<i> OK </i>the change. Now select
the<i> In-sert Loudspeaker [l] </i>icon and click anywhere on the red x-axis
line. When the Property sheet appears, set the x value to 3. Then, repeat<i> </i>the
process to add another loudspeaker at -3. Your screen should now look like the
one shown at the top of the next page.</p>
<p>Note that if you had used the <i>Shift + z</i> key command to
enter the Editing tab in the Options folder, instead of following the
directions in the previous paragraph, your screen automatically changed to the
Top or Overhead view instead of the 3D view.</p>
<p>The program inserted the loudspeakers as Spheres, the default
loudspeaker. To change the loudspeaker model numbers, select one of the
loudspeakers and use either the <i>Ctrl + F3</i> key command to open the <i>Change
All Same</i> window or right click to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Change
all Same</i>. ( You also could use the <i>F2</i> key command or <i>Change
Speaker Model</i> in in the Mouse menu to change the models individually).
Then, use the <i>Browse</i> and <i>Change</i> buttons to select the desired
model. We will use the Renkus-Heinz STX4/44 for both loud-speakers.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5: Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p><img width=671 height=412
src="E2.files/image101.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that changing to the STX4/44 Introduced outline (wireframe)
drawings (Case drawings) of the loudspeaker. We will need the Case drawings to
make sure our Cluster is physically possible. If you chose to use another
loudspeaker and the wireframe drawing doesn’t ap-pear it’s probably because the
manufacturer of the loudspeaker you chose did not include a Case drawing in his
loudspeaker file. Another possibility is that the Case drawings are not
selected in the Options folder.</p>
<p>You can verify the Case drawing setting by going to the Options
folder (<i>F9</i> or right click on the screen and select <i>Options</i>) and
opening the <i>Items </i>tab. Symbols and Cases should be checked.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>The Cluster module is going to want both loudspeakers designated
as Active loudspeakers, so select (pick) one of them and then open its Mouse
menu by right clicking to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Activate.</i> Note
that the loudspeaker symbol is now red instead of being blue when it is not
selected to show that it is Active. Repeat the procedure with the other
loudspeaker. Another way of turning the loud-speaker Active is the <i>F8</i>
key command. Selecting the loudspeaker and then pressing the <i>F8</i> key
command will turn the loudspeaker Active. Note that pressing <i>F8</i> a second
time would deactivate the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>We are now ready to see how our cluster performs. Press <i>F5</i>
to Check Data and then open the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and select <i>Recom-pute
Cluster</i>. This will open the screen shown below.</p>
<p><img width=374 height=278
src="E2.files/image103.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Position (Ft.)</i> and <i>Aiming (deg)</i> fields are
used primarily to place and aim clusters in the Edit Project mode. <i>Position
(Ft.)</i> places the center (reference point) of the Cluster and <i>Aiming
(deg)</i> sets up the reference axis. For our purposes, the Average or Default
settings are fine.</p>
<p>We'll also accept the <i>Complex Integration Method</i> of
calculating the cluster's performance. It uses running time complex
interference to cal-culate the directivity balloon and gives the most realistic
results. <i>Power Summation</i> uses simple energy addition for the
calculations and the <i>Convolution Method</i> uses a formula developed by Mark
Ureda. Approving the setup by clicking on <i>OK</i> will produce the wire
lattice screen shown below. Note that it may be hidden by the Edit Cluster
screen, so minimize the Edit Cluster screen if you can't see the wire lattice
screen.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>As you can see, it's difficult to read. To get a better picture,
open the <i>Mapping</i> pull down menu and select <i>Render Balloon.</i> Render
Balloon offers a wide range of far more descriptive displays. A top (overhead)
view of the cluster balloon is shown below.</p>
<p><img width=516 height=326
src="E2.files/image105.jpg"></p>
<p>Use the Zoom [F11] tool and the scroll bars to study the
cluster's performance. Notice the severity of the lobing. If you can't see all
the col-ors in the color chart, open the Utilities pull down menu and select
either <i>Show Legend</i> or <i>Insert Legend</i>. This will introduce a new
color legend with scroll bars so you can identify all the colors.</p>
<p>This cluster's severe lobing is typical for a pair of
loudspeakers mounted side by side, but a few feet apart. It shows in a very
graphic fash-ion why this type of arrangement should be avoided..</p>
<p>We obviously need to bring the loudspeakers together into a
&quot;tight pack&quot; array. This means we have to return to the Edit Cluster
window. If the Balloon screen is obscuring the Edit Cluster window, either
minimize it or click on the Edit Cluster icon in the Windows status bar at the
bottom of the screen. Start by switching the screen from the 3D view to Top
view (Use the Down Arrow icon in the Tool bar.)</p>

<p>Pick S1 and then open its Properties folder. Then change the x
value from 3 to 0.5 and hit <i>Apply</i> to see the result. Now you see why
it’s important to have the Case drawing. The array isn’t physically possible as
the loudspeaker cabinets overlap.</p>
<p>Note that the previous paragraph assumed you were in the
symmetrical modeling mode. If you are not, you will need to select S2 and
change it to -0.5 before you can see the overlap.</p>
<p>It's also apparent that we need to rotate the cabinets.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image107.jpg"></p>
<p>The STX4/44 is an 18 degree trapezoidal cabinet. Insert 18 into
the <i>Hor. Angle</i> field and view the result using <i>Apply</i>. Next, try
0.37 as the X value. This should put S1 into the correct position. <i>OK</i>
the changes.</p>
<p>Now repeat the operation with S2, only change the x value to
-.37 and the Hor. angle to -18. View the result and then hit <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315

<p>A 3D view of the Custer is shown below. Note that there are two
loudspeaker symbols. The Cluster is still viewed by EASE as two loud-speakers.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image109.jpg"></p>
<p>To view the performance, hit <i>F5</i> to tell the program to
Check Data. This will also transfer the data from its temporary storage spot to
the Main file, assuming Auto Apply is turned <i>On</i> in the Main Option menu.
Then open the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and select <i>Recompute Clus-ter. OK
</i>the setup and then view the wire lattice screen presentation. Now go to the<i>
Mapping </i>pull down menu and select<i> Render Balloon</i>.<i> </i>As you can
see most of the severe lobing has disappeared.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image110.jpg"></p>
<p>In this exercise we brought the two loudspeakers together by
using their Properties folders. Another way, and the one that is usually used,
is to use the <i>Shift + Arrow</i> Key Commands to move the loudspeakers. To
see how this works, select one of the loudspeakers and then hit <i>Shift +
Right Arrow. </i>The selected loudspeaker undoubtedly moved far more than you
anticipated. That is because the default Stepwidth<i> </i>setting is 3.28 feet.
Right click on the screen to open the Mouse Menu, select <i>Stepwidth</i> and
change the Step distance to .02 or .03 and <i>OK</i>. Then, use the<i> Shift +
Arrow Key Commands </i>to move the loudspeakers. It's the easy way to go when
you don’t know the exact coordi-nates.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, that we are happy with the cluster's performance, it is
time to save it as a single loudspeaker. Return to the Main Speaker Base
win-dow, open the <i>File</i> pull down menu and select <i>Save Speaker</i> (or
use the <i>Ctrl + s</i> key command). A prompt will appear asking you to name
the loudspeaker. Use Cluster_1 as the name, verify that the location in which
the file is being saved is the location where you want it saved and then click
on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>To verify that a new loudspeaker file has been created, reopen
the Circus_2 project created in the previous exercise and select the Insert
Loudspeaker [l] tool. Click on the screen and when the Loudspeaker Properties
window appears place the loudspeaker at 0, 30, 45. Press the [.] change button
and then Browse to open the loudspeaker database. Select <i>Cluster_1</i>, add
it to the project menu and <i>OK</i>. Now ap-prove the insertion by hitting <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Zoom in on the Loudspeaker and you'll see the two cabinet
cluster was added as a single loudspeaker. Although the wireframe shows two
cabinets, there is only one loudspeaker symbol.</p>
<p><img width=516 height=323
src="E2.files/image111.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that if the wireframe doesn’t show in the model, it’s
because you are still in the symmetrical modeling mode. Go the Room Data (right
click on the screen and select Room Data) and turn off (uncheck) <i>Room
Symmetric</i>.</p>
<p>The Cluster Program enables you to construct clusters of
different sizes and types, study their performance and then save them for
future use. You are encouraged to spend a few minutes modeling some of the
clusters you have used in your projects and studying their perform-ance. Try
changing models to see how much difference this makes. What you find may
surprise you. You will learn that all loudspeakers are not created equal when
it comes to cluster performance. Some loudspeakers, such as the SRX4/44, array
much better than others.</p>
<p>One word of caution. EASE cannot accurately calculate the performance
of clusters unless it has accurate phase information on the loud-speakers used
in the cluster. Many of the loudspeaker files in 4.3 were imported from earlier
versions of EASE and do not include phase information. As a result, EASE 4.3 is
not able to accurately project their performance in clusters.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure phase information is included in the
loudspeaker you are using, go to the Loudspeaker DataBase, open the
Loud-speaker’s folder, and select <i>Phase Data</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull
down menu. If the spreadsheet contains only 0s, (zeros), phase data is not
in-cluded.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 5: Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Using Edit Project to Build Clusters</b></p>
<p>Now, lets try out the Cluster building capabilities of the Edit
Project module. Delete the cluster we just added to the Circus_2 model. We are
going to build the same cluster using the Edit Project program module. We'll
start by switching to the overhead view and using the Mouse menu to select <i>Edit
xy Plane</i>. Set the Plane level at 48 Ft.. Then use the <i>Insert Loudspeaker
[l]</i> icon in the tool bar sor to insert a loudspeaker. When the Loudspeaker
Properties sheet opens, insert the loudspeakers exact location (set x to 3 and
y to 30).</p>
<p>Note that the program placed the loudspeaker at a height of 45
Ft., the editing plane we set up. We want to use the same loudspeakers we used
in the previous cluster example, so select the STX4/44. (Use the <i>[.]</i>
change button to open the selection window and select the STX4/44.) Then <i>OK</i>.
Use the Insert <i>Loudspeaker [l</i>] icon to insert the second loudspeaker at
x = - 3 and Y = 0.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image112.jpg"></p>
<p>The loudspeakers need to be turned Active. Use the Activate
command in the Mouse menu to individually turn them Active or go to the <i>Item
</i>pull down menu and choose<i> Select Active Items/Loudspeakers</i>. Turn
them<i> On</i>. Now it is time to Check Data again [<i>F5]</i>. Then open the<i>
Insert </i>pull down menu and select<i> Calculate Cluste</i>r Note that we are
duplicating the steps we took in the previous example when we cre-ated a
cluster using the Main Speaker Base program. As soon as you <i>OK</i> the
setup, EASE will ask you to name the cluster.</p>
<p>After you finish naming the cluster, EASE will calculate its
performance and then ask if you want to Replace Active Loudspeakers. Answer-ing
<i>Yes</i> will change the screen to the one shown below. Note that the two
loudspeaker symbols turned into a single symbol centered be-tween the two wireframe
drawings. The program now sees the two loudspeakers as a single device.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image113.jpg"></p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The program also asks if you want to Show Balloon. Answering <i>Yes</i>
will open the 3-D balloon display showing the clusters performance. A quick
comparison between this balloon and the one generated in the Main Speaker Base
example will show you that they are identical.</p>
<p>You can obtain further verification of this by ungrouping the
cluster and then moving the two loudspeakers together as we did in the
previ-ous exercise. To do this, go to the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and
select <i>Explode Cluster</i>. It's that simple. Now, proceed to bring the
loud-speakers together just like you did before and then make a Cluster just as
you did before. When you are done, you'll again see that the performance is the
same as the Cluster built under the Main Speaker Base program.</p>
<p><b>Several words of caution</b>:</p>
<p><b>1. Cluster performance is calculated only for the Far
Field and should not be utilized for Near Field simulations.</b></p>
<p><b>2. If the distance between the loudspeakers in an array
is too great, the cluster algorithms show results similar to those ob-tained
with single loudspeakers because of the small amount of interference between
the individual loudspeakers. The rule is that the distance between loudspeakers
should not be greater than a wavelength at 100 Hz for meaningful results.
Trying to evaluate lower frequencies is of little value because the patterns
are essentially non directional.</b></p>
<p><b>Turning Clusters into Objects</b></p>
<p>It's easy to turn loudspeaker arrays into an Object having many
of the same characteristics as a Cluster. As an Object they can be Dupli-cated,
Displaced, Turned, Rotated and Saved as a single item just like any other
Object. They also look just like a Cluster.</p>
<p>The main difference is that the individual Loudspeakers retain
their identity and are not grouped together as a single loudspeaker, as they
are in the Cluster module. This allows EASE to correctly calculate both the
free space Far Field directivity balloon and the individual Near Field
directivity balloons. The entire directivity behavior is distance related
correct, both in the Far Field and in the Near Field. The other difference you
will notice is that instead of being saved as an .obj file like other Objects,
Cluster Objects are saved as a .fla file containing all the loudspeaker
Properties.</p>
<p>Let's try it out. Return to the Circus_2 model, select the
Cluster, go to the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and select <i>Explode Cluster</i>
to turn the Cluster back into two individual loudspeakers. Then go back to the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu and use Create Object to turn the two loud-speakers into an
Object. If you have forgotten the steps to creating an Object or skipped that
part of the Tutorial return to page 123 to re-view the steps.</p>
<p>When you are done, the Object (Cluster) will look like this.</p>
<p><img width=516 height=323

<p>138</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5: Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that you can still select the loudspeakers individually and
manipulate them just like you can any individual loudspeaker. You can ro-tate,
turn, move, adjust power levels, change models, etc. The loudspeakers are also
treated individually in all calculations and all calcula-tions performed with
these arrays will take longer than those performed with a Cluster. But, when <i>Interference</i>
is turned On they will be more accurate in the Near Field. In the Far Field the
results will be the same.</p>
<p>Of course, Cluster Objects can also be saved and used again in
other projects. Select the Object and use the mouse menu and <i>Save As</i>.</p>
<p><b>Creating Case Drawings</b></p>
<p>Case or Wireframe drawings serve two useful functions. First,
they allow you to verify that the loudspeaker placement(s) are physically
possible; i.e., that part of the cabinet doesn't protrude through the ceiling
or that the cabinets in an array are not overlapping. They are also useful in
showing clients how the loudspeaker(s) will appear in their room.</p>
<p>Creating Case drawings (Wireframe drawings) for loudspeakers
that do not have a Case drawing is a relatively simple procedure and does not
affect the Loudspeaker's authentication. You can create a Case drawing for any
loudspeaker and save it without losing the loud-speakers authentication.</p>
<p>Open the <i>File</i> pull down menu in the EASE Main menu window
and select <i>Main Databases/Speaker Model</i>s/SpeakerBase. When the Main
Speaker Base module opens, select <i>New Speaker</i> from the <i>File</i> pull
down menu. Then select <i>Case</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu. This
will open a slightly modified version of the Edit Room module. Here you will
construct the loudspeaker Case (wireframe) drawing, just as you would construct
a room.</p>
<p>The difference is that we will be creating a wireframe drawing
using Edges, instead of creating Faces as we have done in our other exer-cises.
We’ll start with a basic rectangular loudspeaker. We'll assume the loudspeaker
is 36&quot; tall, 18&quot; wide and 24&quot; deep (3’ tall, 1.5’ wide and 2’
deep).</p>
<p>We’ll start by inserting a Vertice at 0, 0, 0. Then
Duplicate/Displace it by -2’ in the x field to create the other bottom front
corner. Then use the <i>Insert Edge [e]</i> tool to create the bottom Edge.
After that it’s a simple matter of using Duplicate/Displace to create the other
front and rear Edges. The final step in creating the cabinet is to use the <i>Insert
Edge [e]</i> tool again to add the side edges.</p>
<p>When you are done your drawing will look like this.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315

<p>139</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Creating a wireframe drawing for a trapezoidal cabinet is almost
as easy. The only problem you may encounter is not knowing the width of the
rear of the cabinet. That doesn’t present a problem if you know the side
angles. For our purposes let’s assume we are working with a 15 degree
trapezoidal cabinet of the same height, width and depth of the previous
cabinet.</p>
<p>Start by inserting the two front corner Vertices (0,0,0, and -2,
0,0). Then select one of the Vertices, P2 for example and open the Mouse menu
and select <i>Duplicate</i>. We’ll be using the Polar capabilities of
Duplicate/Displace to insert the rear Vertices. Insert 2 into the <i>Dist</i>
field (the cabinet is 2 feet deep) and 165 (180 minus 15) into the <i>hor:</i>
field.</p>
<p>Note that as you do this, the program calculates the Cartesian
distances and the y distance ends up being less than 2. We want the cabi-net to
be 2 feet deep, so change y back to 2. Note that as you do this the program
recalculates the Polar dist (the length of the line be-tween the two Vertices).
Click <i>OK</i> to insert the Vertice.</p>
<p><img width=421 height=191
src="E2.files/image116.jpg"></p>
<p>Use the same procedure to insert the other rear Vertice only
change the Polar <i>hor:</i> figure to -165.</p>
<p>Now that the four bottom Vertices are in place it’s a simple
matter to Duplicate/Displace them 3 feet in the z direction tocreate the top
ver-tices. Adding the Edges is a snap with all the Vertices in place.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image117.jpg"></p>
<p>The last step is to change the location of the 0, 0, 0 point
from its present location to where the cabinet’s Insertion or Reference
(Rotation) point is located. Most manufacturers use the point they used as the
center of the directivity balloon while they were taking measurements; i.e.,
the point around which they rotated the cabinet. Typically this point is placed
at the rear of the high frequency horn.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5: Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The 0, 0, 0 point is currently the lower right corner of the
cabinet. Let’s assume we want the Insertion point to be 12” from the top of the
cabinet and 6” from the rear on the center line (x axis).</p>
<p>To do this, go to the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and select <i>Move
Point of Reference</i> to open the dialog box shown below.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember when filling in the x, y, z move
parameters is that you will actually be moving the cabinet and not the
Ref-erence Point. It stays at the same spot and the cabinet moves. The correct
values are shown below.</p>
<p><img width=500 height=524
src="E2.files/image118.jpg"></p>
<p>The final wireframe drawing is shown below. The 0, 0, 0 point is
where the drawing will be inserted into a project.</p>
<p>The last step is to save the Wireframe drawing. First <i>Check
Data[F5]</i>; then close the Edit Case Speaker window and return to the Speaker
module. Answer <i>Yes</i> to the Apply Project Data prompt that appears and
then go to <i>Save Speaker</i> under the <i>File</i> pull down menu or do a <i>Ctrl
+ S </i>to save the file.</p>
<p><b>Creating New Loudspeaker Files</b></p>
<p>It's possible that you may have occasion to add a new
loudspeaker to the Speaker Database either by importing measurement data or by
manually inserting the data.</p>
<p>The details for adding loudspeaker data into the Speaker
Database can be found in the EASE SpeakerBase section of the EASE Manual.</p>
<p>It's Chapter 10. The EASE Manual is stored as a PDF document
