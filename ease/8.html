<p>Vision
allows you to enhance the visual aspects of a model by adding light and shadows
to the room and Textures to the surfaces.</p>
<p>Open
Vision 1 (go to <i>File/Open Project</i> and select <i>Vision 1</i> or use the
desktop icons). When the Loading Complete/Draw Room prompt ap-pears answer <i>No</i>;
then select <i>Standard Rendering</i> from the <i>View</i> pull down menu.
We’ll take a look at the model in Standard Rendering be-fore we proceed to the
Vision module.</p>
<p>This
will open the screen shown below. Probably the first thing you will notice is
that a large Face has been placed outside the room. Its purpose will become
clear when we open the Vision module.</p>
<p><img
width=520 height=313 src="E3.files/image013.jpg"></p>
<p>This
would probably be a good time to take a good look at the Room. Click on the
Walker icon and use it to walk around the Room. When you have finished with
your tour, close the Standard Rendering module and return to the Main menu and
select <i>Architectural Ren-dering</i>. This will open the screen shown below.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that except for a few color changes, it looks pretty much the same as the
Standard Rendering version. Vision has 4 rendering modes and opens in the
OpenGL Simple Map mode which doesn’t show reflections, shadows and variations in
color or shade. For a better dis-play, open the <i>Calculations</i> pull down
menu and select <i>OpenGL Texture Map</i>. <i>OK</i> the setup parameters. Be
prepared for the rendering to a minute or two. This model has 899 Faces and the
rendering takes time. You can watch the progress in the <i>Process Tile</i>
readout above the Tool Bars. The same readout area will post the file size as
soon as the rendering is completed.</p>
<p><img
width=520 height=313 src="E3.files/image015.jpg"></p>
<p>The
first thing you’ll probably notice is that the large Face outside the model is
a Mountain scene. It’s purpose is to add realism to the model by allowing you
to look out the windows while inside the model and see the scenery outside.
We’ll do that later.</p>
<p>You
probably also noticed the model is dark. The reason is that the lights are not
turned on. In Vision, as in real life, you need light to see. Click on the <i>Bulb</i>
icon and when the Bulb listing appears turn on all the lights (right click on <i>OK</i>
to select all the items and then left click to <i>OK </i>the selection.)<i> OK </i>the
Recalculate prompt and the Calculation Setup Parameters when they appear.</p>
<p>You’ll
notice a big difference when the rendering is completed.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Both
the OpenGL Simple Map and OpenGL Texture Map rendering modes allow you to move around
the model. Select the <i>Walker</i> Icon or just click on the model to open the
Walker and take a walk around the room. The Eye Icon in the Walker window gives
you a choice of Or-thographic or Perspective views.</p>
<p>You
should also try using the Turn feature. Select the <i>Turn</i> icon. Then hold
down the left mouse button to turn right or left or up and down, and the right
mouse button to move forward, backward, right and left in the room. It’s a
quick and easy way to move around the model once you get the feel for it.</p>
<p><img
width=520 height=313 src="E3.files/image017.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice
that the rendering is blurred and jagged in some areas. This is primarily a
matter of resolution. To go to a higher resolution render-ing, go to the <i>Calculations</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Scanline</i>. Notice how the rendering improves
(see below.)</p>
<p><img
width=522 height=323 src="E3.files/image018.jpg"></p>
<p>Raytracing,
the 4th rendering mode produces an even higher-resolution, photo-realistic
rendering. If you have the time, try it out. You’ll see another big change. One
word of caution, neither Scanline or Raytracing rendering modes allow you to
use the Walker to move around the room.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Using
Vision</b></p>
<p>Now,
it’s time to use Vision. Close the Vision 1 model and open the Model_2 project
we worked with earlier.</p>
<p>As we
learned earlier, Vision requires light. Accordingly, our first step will be to
add Lamps to the Model-2 project. To start, we'll put in a row of Lamps 3 feet
below the ceiling peak on 15 foot centers starting at the rear wall.</p>
<p>Open
the Edit Project module and click on the <i>Insert Lamp</i> icon (the light
bulb icon). When the Lamp Properties sheet opens, correct the X,Y, Z
coordinates to 0, -67, 22 and set the Intensity to 30. The default Intensity of
0.0 isn't very bright.</p>
<p><img
width=385 height=343 src="E3.files/image019.jpg"></p>
<p>Next,
use the right mouse button to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Duplicate</i>.
When the Displacement window opens, insert 15 in the y field and 4 into the <i>Repeated</i>
field. Press <i>OK</i>. It's that easy to add a row of lights.</p>
<p><img

<p><b>EASE
4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Next
use the <i>F6</i> function key to <i>Apply and Save</i> the changes and then go
to the <i>View</i> pull down menu and select <i>Architectural Rendering</i> to
open the Vision module.</p>
<p>The
initial image will be dark because Vision has not had the opportunity to render
the model. Vision offers four rendering methods.</p>
<p><b>OpenGL
Simple Map </b>is the fastest, but does not include Textures in the image it
produces.</p>
<p><b>OpenGL
Texture Map </b>takes longer but does include Textures.</p>
<p><b>Scanline
</b>produces higher resolution images than either of the two OpenGL
methods, but usually takes longer to produce the image.</p>
<p><b>Raytracing
</b>produces the highest quality images, but requires longer
calculation times.</p>
<p>Both
OpenGL methods allow you to move around in the model. Scanline and Raytracing
do not. As a result most users use one of the OpenGL methods during the initial
setups (adjusting the lights and applying Textures) and then switch to either
the Scanline or Raytracing method after they are satisfied with the model and
have the view they want to save.</p>
<p>Before
we render the model, we need to make sure the Lamps are turned on. Click on the
<i>Lamps</i> icon in the tool bar. When the Lamps list-ing appears select all
of the Lamps to turn them On. Remember a right click on <i>OK</i> will select
all the Lamps and a left click on <i>OK</i> will then register the selection.</p>
<p>Now, go
to the <i>Calculation</i> pull down menu and select either the Scanline or the
OpenGL Texture Map rendering method.</p>
<p>The
image below was made with Scanline.</p>
<p><img
width=524 height=323 src="E3.files/image021.jpg"></p>
<p>Obviously,
we have a hot spot on the front wall. The default Lamp is a sphere and is
throwing more light on the front wall because it is closer to it than it is to
the floor. We could correct this by moving it, by changing to a more
directional Lamp or by reducing its intensity. For now, lets just change its
intensity. Return to Edit Project, select the Lamp at the front of the room
(it’s L5) and reduce its Intensity to 10. <i>Check Data[5] </i>and return to
Vision. Select<i> Acquire Project Data [Ctrl + O</i>] and use Scanline (under
Calculations) to redraw the graphic.<i> </i>You’ll see the hot spot is greatly
reduced. For now, accept the lighting setup. We can always come back to it at a
later time.</p>
<p>Vision
allows you to apply Textures to all surfaces. One of the attributes that can be
assigned to Textures is Transparency. To illustrate this, we'll turn the
windows transparent so we can look through them and see the outside landscape.
Return to <i>Edit Project</i>, Pick one of the win-dows and then right click to
open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Properties</i>.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>Chapter
8: Vision</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>When
the Properties window opens, select the <i>Textures</i> Tab. This will open the
screen shown below. Use the <i>[.]</i> button to change the de-fault Wall
Texture to <i>glass_10_medium.tex</i>, a transparent Texture. Note that the
procedure is the same as the one we've been using to change Wall Materials and
Loudspeakers.</p>
<p><img
width=263 height=273 src="E3.files/image022.jpg"></p>
<p>You
will also notice a Copy To button. This button allows you to copy this Face's
Texture to other Faces. It makes it easy to assign Textures to a number of
Faces. Try it out by copying this Texture to the other windows. Click on <i>Copy
To</i> and follow the prompts to select the other Window Faces. You’ll need to
know the Labels of the other window Faces, but its fast and easy.</p>
<p>Now,
let's check to make sure the windows are truly transparent. Check Data [F5] and
then reopen the Vision window. At this point, Vision doesn't have the changes
we made in Edit Project. Go to the <i>File</i> pull down menu and click on <i>Acquire
Project Data</i> or use the <i>Ctrl + O</i> key command. Then use Scanline to
refresh the window.</p>
<p><img
width=524 height=323 src="E3.files/image023.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice
that the color of the windows has changed. The only problem is that we are
looking out the window at the background color of the screen. We need to add a
landscape to look at. Adding one is easy to do. The first step is to create a
large Face outside the room model. It's exact size is relatively unimportant.
All we want is for it to be large enough that we'll be seeing it no matter what
angle we look out the window.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>EASE
4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Before
we add this external Face we need to do two things. So far, we have been
modeling in the Symmetrical modeling mode. Since we will be adding only one
Face, we need to change to the non-symmetrical mode. We will also be placing
the Face outside a Closed room and EASE doesn’t like that and will view the new
Face as a Hole in the model. As a result, it won’t let you Check Data until the
Hole is elim-inated. The simple solution to this is to turn the model into an
Open room.</p>
<p>Return
to Edit Project, right click on the screen and select <i>Room Data</i> from the
Mouse Menu that pops up. Then put a check in the <i>Room</i> <i>Open </i>box
and uncheck the<i> Room Symmetric </i>box.</p>
<p>For
practice, let's try a method of adding a Face that we haven't used before, the
Insert Rectangle tool. Switch to the <i>Side [x]</i> view and then click on the
<i>Insert Rectangle</i> iconl. Use the Mouse cursor to place the upper left
corner of the Face where you want it, and then move the Cursor to the lower
right corner and click. It's that simple.</p>
<p>EASE
probably placed the Face at x = 0. We want it at x = -50, so use the Mouse Menu
to <i>Displace</i> the Face by -50. This places it 25 feet away from the
outside of the room. The Face we created is inverted (we are looking at the
reflective side) and we want the reflective side facing the room. Use the <i>Invert</i>
tool to correct this.</p>
<p>Another
way to have added this Face would have been to use the Mouse Menu to change the
yz Editing Plane to -50. Then, the Face would have been added at x = -50 and we
wouldn't have had to move it. To try this out, use the <i>Undo Tool</i> to
remove the Face we just added; then use the Mouse Menu to select the <i>yz-Plane
Value</i>. Enter -50 in the <i>Plane Value</i> field. Now, use Insert Rectangle
again. You'll see the Face was placed at x = -50. EASE has a wide variety of
tools to speed up the modeling process.</p>
<p>The
next step is to add a Texture (Mountain landscape) to this Face. Use the Mouse
Menu to open the Properties folder and then select the Textures Tab. Click on
the <i>Change [.]</i> button and select <i>Mountain_ill_2</i> and <i>OK</i>.
You'll find it stored in the Texture File under the Vision project in
Projects40. The scene will probably appear in the viewing window as a number of
blue lines. This is because the scene isn't sized to the Face. There are two
ways to do this, graphically with the cursor or exactly by using the Texture
Reference Point Fields.</p>
<p><img
width=331 height=343 src="E3.files/image024.jpg"></p>
<p>For our
purposes, the graphic method will be fine. Note that the Field under Texture
Reference Points reads Lower Left. Use the mouse cursor (wand) to set the lower
left corner location by clicking on the lower left corner of the Face in the
graphics window. A pleasant tone signal will tell you the corner has been
placed. Then click on &lt;&lt; to switch to the Upper Left corner and set its
location with the mouse cur-sor. Then repeat the operation to set the Lower
Right corner. When you are done, your screen should look like the one shown.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>Chapter
8: Vision</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>If we
had wanted to be exact, we would have selected <i>Select Point</i>. This would
have opened a listing of the Face Vertices. Selecting the correct Vertex, the
lower left corner Vertex, for example, would then have placed the lower left
corner of the mountain scene in the same location as the Face's lower left
Vertex.</p>
<p>Now
approve the changes you have made in the Properties folder by clicking on <i>OK</i>,
<i>Check Data [F5]</i> and return to the Vision Module.</p>
<p>First,
go to the <i>File</i> pull down menu and click on <i>Acquire Project Data</i>.
Then, go to the <i>Calculations</i> pull down menu and select <i>Scanline</i>.</p>
<p>As you
can see from the screen shown below, the mountain scene is in place.</p>
<p><img
width=522 height=323 src="E3.files/image025.jpg"></p>
<p>This
would be a good time to take a walk around the Room and verify that we can look
out the windows and see the mountain. Either se-lect the Walker and take a
walking tour or sit down in one of the Listener Seats (select the <i>View</i>
pull down menu and then <i>Perspective/Lis-tener</i>) and look out the windows.</p>
<p><img
width=509 height=316 src="E3.files/image026.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that if you rendered the Room in Scanline, you will have to render the room
again after you have settled upon your viewing location.</p>
<p>To
avoid having to do this repeatedly, select <i>OpenGL Texture Map</i>. Then,
you'll only have to render the Room once.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p><b>EASE
4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Now
that we have verified that we can see out the windows, lets see if they are
truly transparent and will allow light (sunlight) to enter the Room from the
outside. Return to the Edit Project module and select the <i>Insert Lamp</i>
tool and click on a spot between the Room and the Face we added outside the
Room. When the Properties screen appears, place the Lamp at -45, -40, 25.</p>
<p>Since
we want to shine our light into the Room to simulate sunlight, let's choose a
more directional Lamp than a Sphere. Click on the <i>Change [.] </i>button
and then select the<i> Parallel_Yel.New </i>Lamp. Increase the Lamp Intensity,
too, from 30 to100. Next approve the setup<i> </i>parameters by clicking on <i>OK</i>.
Then use the right mouse button to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Lamp
Aiming</i>. Aim the Lamp at one of the windows.</p>
<p><i>Check
Data [F5] </i>and then return to the Vision Module. Use the<i> File </i>pull
down menu to<i> Acquire Project Data </i>or the<i> Ctrl + 0 </i>key command to<i>
</i>update the Vision module. Click on the <i>Lamp</i> icon and turn the new
Lamp On. Then render the Room to see the sunshine shining on the floor.Creating
A New Light Source</p>
<p><img
width=522 height=317 src="E3.files/image027.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Creating
New Lamps (Light Sources)</b></p>
<p>As we
found out earlier, Vision will not operate properly without lights. The Light
Sources (Lamps) are inserted into the model during the modeling process using
the Room Editor.</p>
<p>A few
Lamps are included in the Light Source library supplied with the program, but
you will probably want to create additional Lamps.</p>
<p>This is
easy to do using the Light Source Editor. Let's try it out.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Open
the Light Source Editor by going to <i>Main Databases</i> under the <i>File</i>
pull down menu in EASE Main and selecting <i>Light Sources</i>.</p>
<p>The
opening Light Source Editor window is shown on the next page.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Select <i>New</i>
from the <i>File</i> pull down menu and choose a name (Label) for the light
source that you want to create. Be creative in as-signing a name (Label) to the
new Light Source. You want to be able to easily identify it.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Enter
the name of the Manufacturer if you want to use a certain product.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>Chapter
8: Vision</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>If you
want to use a color other than white, click on the <i>Color</i> field or the <i>Change
[···]</i> button next to it.. A color palette will pop up giv-ing you the
opportunity to choose an appropriate color for the light source.</p>
<p>Step 5:</p>
<p>The
next step is to choose the type of light. You can choose between a Point Source
with a defined opening angle (Aperture) and a Source of Parallel Light. If you
want to simulate natural light (sun light) illuminating a space, choose the Parallel
Light option. Other-wise, use Point Source and define the opening angle.</p>
<p>Step 6:</p>
<p>When
you are satisfied with the parameters, save the light source by doing a <i>Ctrl
+ s</i> and then reviewing and approving the name and destination Prompt that
appears.</p>
<p><img
width=211 height=278 src="E3.files/image028.jpg"></p>
<p>Let's
try it out by creating a new pale yellow Point Source with a 120 degree opening
angle. We’ll call it <i>LiteYel120</i>.</p>
<p><img
width=213 height=278 src="E3.files/image029.jpg"></p>
<p>Remember
that in our earlier rendering of this Room we noted hot spots on the front and
rear walls and speculated that changing from the Sphere light to a directional
light would eliminate these. Let’s see if our new Lamp works and better than
the Sphere Lamp.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>EASE
4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>The
first thing we will need to do is to reaim the light. EASE aims lamps in the
same fashion it aims loudspeakers; in other words it aims them down the y axis.
We need to aim them stright down at the floor. Return to Edit Project and open
each Lamps Properties folder, change to the LiteYel120 lamp and insert 90 in
the <i>ver</i> field under View Angle. Another way to accomplish this change
would be to select a Lamp and use the Mouse meno <i>Change All Same</i> command
to change all the Lamps to Liteyel120. You could also use <i>Lamp Aiming</i> in
the Mouse menu to individually reaim each Lamp.</p>
<p>Make
the changes<i>, Check Data [F5]</i> and then return to the Vision Module. Use
the <i>File</i> pull down menu to <i>Acquire Project Data</i> or the <i>Ctrl</i></p>
<p>+ <i>0 </i>key command to update the Vision module. Click on
the<i> Lamp </i>icon and turn On all the Lamps. Then render the Room.</p>
<p><img
width=522 height=314 src="E3.files/image030.jpg"></p>
<p>As you
can see from the rendering above, the lighting is better than it was, but still
not perfect.</p>
<p>Working
with lights takes a little practice. But, it's worth it. As any good
photographer will tell you, one of the secrets to great photos is the lighting.
It just takes practice and you'll have to spend some time practicing if you are
going to create photo realistic images.</p>
<p>Fortunately,
in EASE it doesn't take long to create new Light Sources, place them in the
model and view the results. Take some time right now and experiment by creating
several new Light Sources and inserting them into the model. We used an
Aperture opening of 180 and it worked much better.</p>
<p>Try
turning off some of the lights to see what difference that makes. Try varying
the Intensity of the lights. Remember, you do this under Edit Project in each
Lamps Properties Folder.</p>
<p><b>Creating
A New Texture</b></p>
<p>Textures
add further realism to your models by enabling you to take surface properties
such as transparency, roughness and reflection characteristics into account in
your renderings. Textures are assigned to Faces in the Edit Project mode by
opening the Faces Properties Folder and selecting the Textures Tab.</p>
<p>The
Texture Editor Module allows you to create any new Textures needed for specific
projects. Let's see how it works.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Open
the Texture Editor by going to <i>Main Databases</i> under the <i>File</i> pull
down menu in EASE Main and selecting T<i>extures</i>.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Choose <i>New</i>
from the <i>File</i> pull down menu and write the name of the new Texture into
the <i>Label</i> field. Let's use GreyBrick as the name.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>Chapter
8: Vision</b></p>
<p><img
width=672 height=313 src="E3.files/image031.jpg"></p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Enter
any descriptive notes you want to record in the Description field.</p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>Now
that these housekeeping details have been handled, we can start to assign
properties to this Texture, such as transparency, dif-fusion and reflection.
Your choices will depend on the material.</p>
<p>The
properties of every texture are based on characteristics that are defined on
different Layers. Note the Layer chart in the Texture Editor window shown
above. The six basic characteristics are:</p>
<p>- Diffuse Layer</p>
<p>- Reflection Layer</p>
<p>- Transparency layer</p>
<p>- Specular Layer</p>
<p>- Self Illumination</p>
<p>- Bump Map</p>
<p>The
first three parameters (characteristics) are the most important since they
represent the basic properties of a material. Every mate-rial Diffuses a
certain amount of light and Reflects another amount. Some materials, such as
glass are also Transparent. The sum In-tensity of these three primary
characteristics should be 1.</p>
<p>For
example, if you have a surface such as a mirror, you would want it to reflect
100% of the incident light. Accordingly, activate the Reflection Layer and
enter 1 into the Intensity field. At the same time, you should adjust the value
of the Diffuse and Transparency Layers to 0, because the three numbers together
should add up to 1.</p>
<p>If you
want to create a texture representing the properties of a window, you, first of
all, should define the degree of transparency. Let’s say, a window transmits
70% of incident light. Activate the Transparency Layer and enter 0.7 into the
Intensity field. After doing that, it's safe to assume that 30% of the light is
reflected. Accordingly, you would enter 0.3 into the Intensity field of the
Reflection Layer and 0 into the Intensity field of the Diffusion Layer.</p>
<p>The
other 3 layers, Specular, Self Illumination and Bump, further define the
material’s characteristics and how they appear in the ren-derings. Specular
defines the amount of light reflected in a specular way. The higher the value,
the more the surface will shine.</p>
<p>Self
Illumination defines the amount of light emitted into the Room. The higher the
value, the more fluorescent the material.</p>
<p>Bump is
used for rough surfaces, such as tapestry and coarse carpets.</p>
<p>Note
that you may be able to notice the effects of Specular, Self-Illumination and
Bump only in high resolution renderings made with Ray-tracing</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
the Color column in the Layer chart. It allows you to assign colors to the
material. Just click in the Color field and then use the pop up color chart to
choose the color you want.</p>
<p>Another
essential aspect to the Texture Editor is that you can import images into the
different layers as Texture Maps. This enables you to create brick walls, tile
floors and outside views, etc. and produce outstanding photo realistic images.
See below.</p>
<p><img
width=518 height=344 src="E3.files/image032.jpg"></p>
<p>The
file format of the image needs to be either a .bmp or .tga and they must have
24 or 32 Bits per pixel resolution and be appropriately formatted. Not all .tga
and .bmp files will import successfully.</p>
<p>Let’s
assume the end walls in our model are red brick. How can we do that? First of
all, you need to find an appropriate image and save it as a .bmp or .tga.</p>
<p>There
are a number of possible sources for suitable images. If you have AutoCAD or
have access to AutoCAD through a friend or business associate, you will find
that AutoCAD includes an extensive Texture file base. Use Windows Explorer to
open the AutoCAD folder stored under Program Files and then locate and open the
Textures folder. You will note that these images are stored as .tga files.</p>
<p>EASE
also includes a Graphics Converter that will convert most .tga files that don't
want to import successfully to a usable file. Return to the Main Menu and open
the <i>Tools</i> folder in the EASE Directory Tree. Then, select the <i>Graphics
Viewer/Converter</i> icon. This will open the IrfanView module. Opening a .tga
file in InfanView and then saving it, will convert the .tga file into a .tga
that can be used in the Texture Ed-itor.</p>
<p>Another
source of images is the Web. Go to the Web and insert Clip Art into the Search
window. You will find a long list of sites offering clip art, including some
that offer images at no charge. Another possibility is scanning a photograph.
All ways will work. All you have to remem-ber is that the image needs to be
saved in a high resolution 24 or 32 bit format as a .bmp or .tga.</p>
<p>To make
things easier for you, we stored a GreyBrick.bmp file in the EASE40 Texture
Base folder.</p>
<p>Press
the <i>Add</i> button in the Texture Editor window and <i>Browse</i> to <i>Ease40Data/Textures40/TexturesBase</i>
and double click on the <i>Grey-Brick.bmp </i>icon. Note that in the selection
window you may have to change the<i> Files of Type </i>from<i> EASE Texture
(*.tex) </i>to<i> All Files (**) </i>to<i> </i>see the GreyBrick.bmp file.</p>
<p><i>OK </i>the
prompts that pop up as the program loads the image file. Note that a brick
image now appears in the preview window.</p>

<p>When
Vision imports images, it will either expand the image to fill the selected
Face area or will repeat the image again and again until the Face is completely
covered. The Width and Height fields allow you to adjust the rendering size of
the image in case the default size is ei-ther to large or to small.</p>
<p>We want
the image to repeat and fill the selected Face area, so make sure Repeated is
checked. The 3.28. default size is not correct; bricks are roughly 4 times as
long as they are thick.. A brick wall four bricks long and 6 bricks high is
more like 36&quot; (3 Ft.) long and 18&quot; (1.5 Ft.) high, so enter 3.0 for
the Width and 1.5 for the Height.</p>
<p>Note
the <i>More.</i> button. Pressing it will reveal more parameters that can be
changed. See the result of pressing this button below.</p>
<p><img

<p>As you
can see, the Texture Editor even allows you to Modify the color of the Bitmap.
Just click in the <i>Color Modifier</i> field or press the <i>[.]</i> button
and select the color you want. Let’s Choose a dark red. You will not be able to
see the change in the preview window. The modifica-tion takes place in the
Vision module while the image is being rendered.</p>
<p>Once
you are satisfied with the parameters you have established for the new Texture,
Save it and then close the Texture Editor.</p>

<p><b>Assigning
Textures To The Model</b></p>
<p>Now
that we have created a new GreyBrick Texture, lets try it out.</p>
<p>Reopen
the Model 2 project in the Edit Program mode, select one of the front walls and
open its Properties folder. Then select the <i>Textures</i> tab. The window
will open with Wall, the default Texture selected and appearing in the preview
window. Click on the <i>Change [.]</i> button to open the Select Texture
screen, Browse to the Texture database, add <i>GreyBrick</i> to the project and
select it. <i>OK</i> the change and the pre-view window will change to the
GreyBrick image.</p>
<p><img
width=431 height=444 src="E3.files/image035.jpg"></p>
<p>You
will recall that when we inserted the Mountain scene, we needed to place three
corners of the image in the Preview window, either by using the cursor to place
them or the Select Point method. This is necessary when the image needs to be
expanded to fill the area se-lected. In this case, the GreyBrick image will be
repeated until the Face is filled, so all you need to do is to place one corner
of the image and approve the selection by clicking on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Before
we do, lets look at several other aspects of this window. Note that the Texture
can be applied to either the Face or to the Rear or both and that different
Textures can be applied to the Face and to the Rear.</p>
<p>You
will also see <i>Copy To</i> and Acquire <i>From</i> buttons. To fully utilize
the potential of Vision, Textures should be applied to all Faces. The <i>Copy
To </i>and<i> Acquire From </i>buttons make it easy to do this. Clicking on<i>
Copy To </i>will open a listing of all the Faces, so you can quickly se-lect
all the Faces having similar characteristics and copy this Face's Texture to
them. <i>Acquire From</i> lets you acquire a Texture from an-other Face. Both
can save you a lot of time when you start applying Textures to all the Faces in
a model.</p>
<p>Now,
click on <i>OK</i>, if you haven't already, to approve the changes you made in
the Properties folder and <i>Check Data [F5]</i>.</p>

<p><img

<p>Then
open the Vision Module, if it isn't already open, by selecting <i>Architectural
Rendering</i> from the <i>View</i> pull down menu in the EASE Main screen. Note
that if Vision was already open, you will need to go to the <i>File</i> pull
down menu and click on <i>Acquire Data</i>. You need to update the Vision
Module with the changes made under Edit Room.</p>
<p>Make
sure the Lights are turned On (click on the Lamp icon and select all the lamps
from the pop up menu that appears) and then use ei-ther the Walker or the Turn
Icon to get a good view of the front wall.When you have the view you want, go
to the Calculations pull down menu and render the model. As you can see from
the screen shown below, you now have an attractive dark red brick wall to look
at.</p>
<p><img
width=594 height=674 src="E3.files/image036.jpg"></p>
<p>Before
we leave the Vision program module, let’s take a look at the Options folder for
Vision, specifi-cally the Items Tab. Either select <i>Options</i> from the <i>File
</i>pull down menu or use the<i> F9 </i>key command to<i> </i>open the Options
folder and then click on the <i>Items</i> tab.</p>
<p>Notice
that by using the Options folder we could have installed a Default Lamp into
our model without going to the Edit Project Module and inserting a Lamp.</p>
<p>The
Options folder also allows you to increase the intensity of all the Lamps
installed in the Model just by filling in the amount of increase desired.</p>
<p>Both of
these features can be helpful at times.</p>
<p>By now
you must realize that Vision is a very sophisticated program. Additional
details and operating hints for Vision are available in the EASE 43 Manual
stored under Program Files/EASE 4.3/Easepath. Look for Chapter 6.</p>
