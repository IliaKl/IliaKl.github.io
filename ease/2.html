<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to provide you a working knowledge
of the program and its many features and capabilities. This section is intended
to help you become acquainted with the program. The tutorial sections that
follow will lead you through most of the important EASE features, including
room modeling and the acoustic simulation processes.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: Please don't skip any part of the tutorial. The time you
spend working on the various exercises in the tutorial will save you hours and
hours of time later on. Even after you complete the tutorial you will find it
helpful to refer back to it from time-to-time. It contains a wealth of helpful
hints and shortcuts. If you don't have time now to do all the tutorial
exercises, at least scan through the tutorial to become acquainted with all the
features of EASE. Then, use the manual as a reference guide when you need
guidance in how to accomplish specific tasks.</b></p>
<p>*If you are using EASE JR, substitute EASE JR for EASE as you
read this tutorial</p>
<p><b>General Information</b></p>
<p>EASE is actually a number of separate,individual programs or
program modules, some of which are stand alone programs linked together. The
EASE Main program is the Parent program from which all the other programs
(child programs) emanate. During use only the pro-gram(s) needed to perform the
required task(s) need to be running. As a general rule, the various programs
open automatically when they are needed to perform a task, but must be manually
closed.</p>
<p>Stand Alone modules can be run separately without the need to
run the main program; for example, the Speaker Base program can be run to
create or analyze a cluster not associated with a specific opened project.</p>
<p>This technique provides a great deal of flexibility, but it also
requires that data be exchanged between the various program modules. Op-tion
settings give you control over how the exchange takes place (automatically or
manually). The usual setting has the data exchange taking place automatically
when the modules are opened or closed (accompanied by a Prompt if you desire
one). However, even when the option settings call for automatic exchange, there
are times the exchange may have to be initiated manually. You'll encounter
examples of this as you work your way through the tutorial.</p>
<p>A list of all the program modules and block diagram showing the
primary program module structure can be found in the Appendix at the end of
this manual. You may want to take a few minutes to study the block diagram as
an understanding of the relationship between mod-ules is helpful in
understanding the program.</p>
<p><b>Key Commands</b></p>
<p>With EASE you will be using both key commands and a mouse,
especially while modeling a room. Key commands are helpful as they speed up
many of the processes and you should make a point of learning them as you work
with the program. This is especially true if you will be using the program
regularly. You’ll be surprised how much faster modeling goes once you start
using the key commands.</p>
<p>A few of the key commands you will want to memorize follow.
Notice that the key commands vary from module to module.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 Manual</b></p>
<p>The EASE 4.3 Manual is essentially a PDF version of the EASE
Help files. It was loaded onto your computer along with the program and stored
in the EASE 4.3 Manual folder under EASE 4.3/Easepath in your computers Program
Files directory.</p>
<p>Take a look at it. You may want to print it and use it as a
handy refer-ence manual. It contains a wealth of idetailed information on the
pro-gram, including an Appendix that describes and details the Acoustic
Formulae used in EASE and a detailed list of all the key commands.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Starting EASE</b></p>
<p>From the Windows Start menu, choose <i>All Programs</i> and then
select EASE or double click on the EASE 4.3 icon placed on your desktop by the
installation program.</p>
<p>Note that if this is the first time you have opened EASE, a
screen prompt will ask for your name. Add it and then click <i>OK</i>. Then the
Main Menu screen shown below will open.</p>
<p><img width=670 height=484
src="E1.files/image029.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE 4.3 offers you three different ways to take the next step.
You can open the <i>File</i> pull down menu, use the Tool Bar Icons at the top
of the window or use the Desktop Icons to make your selection,. The choice is
yours, use the method that works best for you.</p>
<p>Notice that placing the cursor over any one of the Tool Bar
icons or Desktop icons brings up a description of that icon’s function. This is
a standard feature of the user friendly GUI of EASE 4.3.</p>
<p>You may also have noticed that the Edit and View pull down menus
in the Menu Bar are not active. They will be activated as soon as a project is
selected and read into RAM..</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>One of the features of EASE 4.3 is the ability to build your own
Desktop with shortcuts to the functions you most often use. To see how this
works, double-click on the Start Working icon, then double-click on the Desktop
icon. This will open the screen shown below.</p>
<p><img width=511 height=371
src="E1.files/image030.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the yellow Desktop section is blank. You can easily
add shortcuts to the Desktop by selecting them with the right Mouse button and
then left clicking on the <i>Add Link to Desktop</i> prompt that appears.
Desktop shortcuts can just as easily be removed by right clicking on them and
then left clicking on the <i>Remove Link to Desktop</i> prompt.</p>
<p>You’ll find the ability to build your own Desktop a useful
feature after you have become familiar with the program ant the functions you
use again and again.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move on and set up the basic operating parameters for
EASE. We’ll use the <i>File</i> pull down menu. Selecting the File pull down
menu opens the menu shown to the right.</p>
<p><img width=340 height=298
src="E1.files/image031.jpg"></p>
<p>This menu or the Desk Top Icons will probably be the starting
point for most of your EASE sessions since it provides access to your various
Project files, to the Import/Export module, to the Main Databases and to the
Options folder.</p>
<p>The File menu also includes a Pack Project command. This
com-mand is used to gather all the individual files associated with a
particular project into a single file that can be easily Zipped and copied onto
a disk for storage or backup, or e-mailed around the world. We’ll work with
Pack Projects later.</p>
<p>Note that it also provides shortcuts to projects you have
recently viewed or worked with. These shortcuts appear as #1 to #8 in the
graphic shown here. Double clicking on one of the shortcuts will open the
associated project.</p>
<p>Your screen will not list any projects unless you opened one or
two projects before starting the Tutorial.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Options</i> command provides access to the program's
primary set up menus. Clicking on <i>Options</i> will open a typical Windows
Option folder. Let’s take a look at several of the tabs (folders).</p>
<p><img width=291 height=250
src="E1.files/image032.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Data</i> tab folder controls the manner in which data is
exchanged (up-loaded and downloaded) between the program modules. Refer back to
page 2x for details. Note that placing the cursor over one of the Options
produces a brief explanation of the Options function. We suggest you ac-cept
the default “Auto” settings.</p>
<p>Note that EASE will warn you if you attempt to run a simulation
without hav-ing properly exchanged data between modules. For example, if after
open-ing one of the Mapping or other post processing modules you make a change
in the model under Edit Project, EASE will warn you a change has been made
before it permits you to run a new simulation. The warning takes the form of a
yellow frame around the simulation screen if the changed proj-ect data was
checked, but not acquired by the simulation module. If the data wasn’t checked,
the frame is red. The Acquire Data icon in the Tool Bar section, Ctrl O or the
File menu option Acquire Project Data will download the new data if it is
Checked.</p>
<p><img width=291 height=250
src="E1.files/image033.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE automatically creates a Temporary Project file whenever you
open the Edit Project program module. When Auto-Apply is checked, the
Tempo-rary Projects file is updated whenever you Check Data. One of its
purposes is to protect you against losing a lot of work, if you inadvertently
close the Edit Project program without having saved your work.</p>
<p>The <i>Delete Temporary Projects</i> section of the Data window
allows you to control whether this file is automatically deleted whenever you
exit the pro-gram or is automatically saved, or whether you are given the
opportunity to decide on an individual basis. This feature does not protect
against com-puter crashes, unless you have saved (applied) your work as you
pro-ceeded. Your best protection against crashes is to routinely and regularly
Apply and Save your changes by using the <i>Ctrl + F6</i> key command.</p>
<p><img width=291 height=250
src="E1.files/image034.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Setting</i> tab allows you to select Metric (m) or
English (Ft.) as the De-fault measurement system. The default setting is
Metric, so change it to English (Ft.) if most of your work will be done in
feet. You also have the op-portunity to change the way the program looks (Play
Animated Messages) and sounds (Play EASE Sounds). We recommend the default
settings, but you may want to try out the Animated Messages.</p>
<p>The <i>Default Paths</i> tab shows you the various default paths
the program has established and gives you the opportunity to change them. We
strongly suggest leaving them as they are unless you have a good reason to
change them. The Default Paths shown reflect the Microsoft recommended path
structure used in Vista installations. If you are an XP user, the path
structure will probably be <i>C:\Ease40Data\.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Video Adapter</i> tab provides a means of quickly
checking your Video Drivers ability to handle Open GL renderings. The <i>Run
Check</i> but-ton will look for your system’s Video Driver and then display its
parameters in the left field. <i>Load Database</i> produces a listing of Video
Driv-ers whose Open GL performance has been checked by ADA. The Font tab give
you the opportunity to change the type of Font used by the program and its
size.</p>
<p>The User tab provides a location for you to register your name
and enter (store) your User ID number. <b>All users should enter their name</b>
<b>and User ID number before proceeding.</b></p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>A Brief Tour</b></p>
<p>Before we begin to model a new room, lets take a short walk
through the program. Warning, if before starting the Tutorial you explored the
program and changed some of the settings, you may not see the exact screens
shown in the Tutorial. If you experience graphic problems or Open GL warnings
during the tour, the chances are you have a video driver problem.</p>
<p><b>Opening a Project</b></p>
<p>EASE offers you three ways to open a Project; <i>Open Project</i>
under the <i>File</i> pull down menu, the <i>Open Project</i> icon (the file
folder icon) in the Tool Bar or the <i>Start Working</i> icon on the Desk Top.</p>
<p>Either method will take you to the Projects40 Folder where you
can select the desired project. We want to review the Theater1_09 project. It
should be stored in the EASE40Data/Projects40/ Theater 1 folder on your C:
Drive. We’ll use the <i>Open Project</i> icon in the Tool Bar to open the
project.</p>
<p>Note: If during installation you elected to store the EASE40
Data on another drive, it will be located there instead of on the C: Drive.
Vista users will find the Projects40 folder under C;\documents and Settings\All
Users\Shared Documents\EASE40 Data.</p>
<p>Click on the icon, then select <i>Theater 1</i> and <i>Theater
1_09.frd</i>. This will bring up (upload) the Theater1_09 files and introduce a
Prompt ad-vising you that the Loading is complete and asking if you want to
“Draw Room”. Answering <i>Yes</i> will open the Edit Project window. For now,</p>
<p>click on .</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Project Data Files</b></p>
<p>The tree in the left panel represents a quick way to review the
data files associated with the project and then, if you want, print a hard copy
for your files. Selecting <i>Loudspeakers</i>, for example, produces in the
right panel a listing of all the loudspeakers used in the project, com-plete
with their locations and their aiming angles.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Send Picture To</i> from the <i>File</i> pull down
menu will give you the choice of sending the window to the Clipboard, to File
in a number of different file formats, or to the EasePage Designer. The
EasePage Designer allows you to customize the graphic by adding notes and then
either save or print the graphic.</p>
<p>Saving the window to the Clipboard allows you to copy the window
into another program such as Word, customize it and then file it away or print
it.</p>
<p>No matter how you save it, you end up with a hard copy list of
the Loudspeakers being used in the project and their location that you can turn
over to your installation crew. It takes all the guesswork out of where to hang
the loudspeakers and how to aim them.</p>
<p><img width=647 height=485
src="E1.files/image036.jpg"></p>
<p>Now it’s time to open the Edit Project Data window where most of
the modeling takes place.</p>
<p>Either select the <i>Edit Project Data</i> icon in the tool bar
or click on <i>Project Data</i> under the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=672 height=495
src="E1.files/image037.jpg"></p>
<p>Note the intersecting red, green and blue lines. They mark the
0, 0, 0 point of the model and the x, y and z axis to help you keep your
ori-entation while viewing the model from different angles. Green is the + y
axis, Red the + x axis and Blue the + z axis.</p>
<p>The blue icons represent loudspeakers.</p>
<p>The purple lines show the loudspeaker aiming points and can be
easily turned off.</p>
<p>The areas outlined in green are the Audience Areas upon which
most of the performance mapping will take place.</p>
<p>The red chairs are Listener Seats that have been placed in the
model for use in detailed electro-acoustic simulations.</p>
<p>As you can see, the top portion of the Edit Project screen is
devoted to the Main menu bar and a number of Tool Bars. The left side of the
screen has two Tool Bars, the ones most often used in constructing a model.
These Tool Bars place within easy reach the most frequently used tools needed
to Edit (construct or change) a model. Don't worry about having to memorize
their use; dragging the cursor over any tool brings up its description. Try it,
it works.</p>
<p>The status bar at the bottom of the screen gives you the
identity and location of any item you have selected (picked) and other useful
sta-tus information.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that many of the Tool Bar commands can
also be initiated with Key commands. If you know the Key commands, it’s usually
easier and faster to use them. Most, if not all of the commands can also be
accessed by using the pull down menus in the Main menu bar. The Tool Bars can
be moved to any spot on the screen by grabbing the Move bar on their left side
and dragging them to a new location. They can also be deleted and then restored
at a later time using the Modify Toolbar command under the File pull down menu.</p>
<p>The scroll bars on the sides and bottom of the screen allow you
to turn, rotate and resize the room drawing. They make it easy to view the room
from any angle, a very important feature. Try out the scroll bars. Its fun, and
you need to become familiar with them.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the model turns or rotates around the center of the
image. You can change this by using the cursor and left mouse button to se-lect
a point on the model. The model will then rotate or turn around that point. It
should be noted that the model itself does not rotate or turn. What is actually
rotated or turned is your point of view of the model. By moving the scroll
bars, you are virtually moving yourself around the model for better viewing.</p>
<p>Another way to turn and rotate the room is the Turn icon in the
Tool Bars. Use the left Mouse button and cursor to turn the drawing and the
right Mouse button to zoom in and out on the drawing.</p>
<p>The F11 and F12 key commands also allow you to Zoom In and Zoom
Out at will. You can also shrink and expand the drawing using the scroll wheel
on your mouse. And, last but not least, the <i>Zoom In</i> icon in the tool bar
section allows you to draw a box around any part of the drawing and zoom in on
it.</p>
<p>When you want to return to the normal isometric view click on
either the <i>3D Perspective</i> icon or the <i>Full</i> icon in the Tool Bars.</p>
<p><b>Terminology</b></p>
<p>To help you understand some of the tools and their use, a brief
description of EASE parameters and terminology follows. The key words are
highlighted in bold type.</p>
<p>In EASE <b>Rooms</b> are constructed from <b>Faces</b> formed by
joining 3 or more <b>Vertices</b> together to define the boundaries (margins)
of the <b>Face</b>. A<b> Face </b>can have from 3 to an unlimited number of<b>
Vertices</b>.</p>
<p><b>Rooms </b>can be<b> Open </b>or<b> Closed</b>. A<b> </b><i>Closed Room</i><b>
</b>is one whose<b> </b><i>Faces</i><b> </b>completely surround (enclose) the<b>
Room</b>. EASE needs a<b> Closed Room </b>before it can calculate the total
surface area and room volume figures needed for many of its simulations.</p>
<p><b>Faces </b>normally have only 1 side of interest to the simulations (the
reflective side) and it must be properly oriented (having the reflective<b> </b>surface
facing into the <b>Room</b>) in order for the <b>Room</b> to be closed, e.g.
have boundary walls. T<b>wo-Fold Faces</b> have two sides that are of interest
to the simulations. They are used to add barriers and reflective/absorptive
panels into the room as well as to paste (<b>Coat</b>) one <b>Fac</b>e on top
of another.</p>
<p><b>Audience Areas </b>are imaginary planes above a
room surface, usually the floor, onto which EASE maps many of its acoustical
simulations.</p>
<p>They are traditionally placed 1.2 m (3.94 feet) above the floor
or at approximately the same height as the ears of seated listeners.</p>
<p>Note: Seating Areas are different than <b>Audience Areas</b>.
They are areas modeled into the room, usually by pasting (<b>Coating</b>) a <b>Two-Fold</b>
<b>Face </b>on top of a floor<b> Face</b>. They make it easy to change the
Room’s acoustical properties to reflect various size audiences by placing<b> </b>materials
having absorption characteristics similar to those of an audience on the
exposed side of the <b>Two-Fold Face</b>.</p>
<p><b>Listener Seats </b>are specific locations (points)
within the<b> Room</b>. They are identified by a chair symbol.</p>
<p><b>Objects </b>are items that have been grouped together
to form a single item (an Object) that can be duplicated, saved or moved as a
single<b> </b>item. <b>Objects</b> can be created from items of different
types; for example from <b>Faces</b>, <b>Loudspeakers</b> and <b>Audience Areas</b>.</p>
<p>When you were practicing with the scroll bars, you may have
noticed that when you picked a spot on one of the Faces, its border changed</p>
<p>from black to either white or yellow. This is the program’s way
of displaying the orientation of that Face. <b>A white outline on a picked Face</b>
<b>means that you are looking at the outside (the non exposed side) of that
Face. Yellow means you are looking at the inside of that Face (the reflective
side), the side that should be facing into the room. Learn this. It’s a crucial
point.</b></p>
<p>Other traditional EASE color assignments are:</p>
<p>The backgroung color is light gray</p>
<p>Vertices are shown in red</p>
<p>Faces are outlined in black until they are selected.</p>
<p>Lamps are yellow.</p>
<p>Other color assignments are possible to suit individual needs or
preferences.</p>

<p><b>Viewing a Project</b></p>
<p>Now, let's continue our exploration of EASE. Return to the Main
window by clicking on it (you may have to first shrink or mininize the Edit
Project window) and select the <i>View</i> pull down menu and choose <i>Standard
Rendering</i>. Choosing Architectural Rendering would have opened the Vision
program module. We’ll explore Vision in detail in another section of this
manual.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Standard Rendering</i> opens a new program called
Eyes. Note that the Edit Project program remains active. The choice of whether
to leave the Edit Project program open or to close it is yours.</p>
<p><img width=513 height=371
src="E1.files/image038.jpg"></p>
<p>The Eyes program module provides a number of different
eye-catching and illuminating ways of looking at the room. Notice that all of
the walls are solid, except for the ones the program removed to allow you to
look into the room. Note that the isometric view may not be the same isometric
view you were seeing in the Room Editor. If it isn’t, use the 3-D icon in the
Tool Bars to change its orientation. Each click on the icon will turn the view
by 90 degrees around the z-Axis.</p>
<p>Next, go to the <i>Item</i> pull down menu and turn off <i>Outline
all Faces</i>. See below.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Some users prefer this view, while others prefer to have all the
Faces outlined as they feel it helps them better visualize the room. Its your
choice. Try selecting Colored Outlines, too. You may like this look even
better. Go to the <i>View</i> pull down menu in the Eyes menu bar and turn off <i>Solid
Rendering</i> by clicking on it to produce another room graphic. Then turn <i>Solid
Rendering</i> back On.</p>
<p>The Audience Areas were probably turned off when you opened
Eyes. Turn them On by going to the <i>Items</i> pull down menu and checking <i>Audience
Areas.</i></p>
<p><img width=499 height=289
src="E1.files/image040.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that under the Items menu, you can also turn “Off” the
Listener Seat and the Loudspeaker symbols.</p>
<p>You also have a choice of showing the Loudspeakers as symbols or
as Case (wireframe) drawings. To make your choice, right click on the screen to
open the Options Folder, select the <i>Items</i> tab and make your choice. It
should be noted that Case drawings for the loudspeakers being used must be
available in EASE before the program can display them. If they aren’t available,
you can create your own Case draw-ings for ones that are missing. We’ll tell
you how later.</p>
<p>The color of the room surfaces (Face colors) was established in
Edit Project Data while the model was being built. Using Face colors is only
one of many ways to color the graphic. Go to the <i>Dye</i> pull down menu to
try out the various ways, especially the <i>Material Alpha</i>, <i>Alpha
Spectrum </i>and<i> Random Color </i>options.</p>
<p>The <i>Material Alpha</i> view allows you to look at the
surfaces based on their absorption characteristics at a specific frequency. The
<i>Alpha</i> <i>Spectrum </i>view paints the surfaces based on their average
absorption over the entire frequency range.<i> Random Color </i>paints each
surface<i> </i>a different color and makes it easy to distinguish one surface
from another.</p>
<p><img width=132 height=262
src="E1.files/image041.jpg"></p>
<p>So far, we have looked at the room from an external point of
view. There are also several ways to look at the room from the inside the
room..</p>
<p>Selecting the <i>Look From Loudspeaker</i> icon in the Tool Bars
(the default position is in the right sec-tion of the top row of Tool Bars)
will open a selection menu giving you the opportunity to choose the Loudspeaker
you want to use to look at the room.</p>
<p>Selecting one (<i>Main</i>, for example) will produce an inside
view of the Room from that loudspeaker’s view point. See next page.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=672 height=328
src="E1.files/image042.jpg"></p>
<p>You can also look at the room from any icon of the Listeners
Seats by clicking on the Look from Listener Seat icon and then selecting one of
the Listener Seats from the selection window that opens.</p>
<p>Notice that in all these views you can also manipulate (turn and
rotate) the view to look at different parts of the room.</p>
<p><b>Using the Walker</b></p>
<p>No tour of an actual room would be complete without walking
around the room and EASE allows you to do just that with the Walker. All you
need to do is click on the Walker icon</p>
<p><img width=582 height=339
src="E1.files/image043.jpg"></p>
<p>If the Walker window is obscuring the graphics, use your mouse
to move it. Notice that a small x, y, z icon has been added to the room
graphic. It shows you the location of the Walker. You can change the location,
by changing the coordinate information in the dialog win-dow or by using the
mouse cursor to grab the x, y, z icon and physically move it.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>If you decide to physically move it, you first will have change
the operating mode of the Mouse. Use key command <i>“p”</i> to switch to the
Pick mode or the <i>Mouse</i> pull down menu. Then you will be able to grab the
x, y, z icon and move it to any location you want.</p>
<p>Note that if you were going step by step through the Tutorial,
the Walker was probably placed at the insertion point of the Main loud-speaker,
the last location selected in the Eyes program. You may have to Zoom In on the
Main loudspeaker to see it as the icon is quite small. A way to avoid this is
to use the cursor to Pick the spot where you want to insert the Walker. The
Walker will automatically open at that spot.</p>
<p><img width=248 height=179
src="E1.files/image044.jpg"></p>
<p>The arrow buttons in the Walker control panel above and below
the Go To button (the pointing finger icon) allow you to move up and down. The
other 4 buttons allow you to move to the right or left and forward or backward
in the room; use the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen to turn your head
and the right scroll bar to look up or down.</p>
<p>To view the room from the Walker location, click on the <i>Eye</i>
icon. It toggles between the Walker (Orthographic and Perspective) viewpoints.
If all you see is a blank wall, it's probably because your head is turned and
you are looking at the rear of the room instead of the front. Use the bottom
scroll bar to turn your head until you can see the front of the room. Take a
walk around, you'll enjoy it.</p>
<p>Note: Even if you do not have EARS, you can also initiate a
direct sound auralization by clicking on the <i>Ear</i> icon. This is true for
both EASE and EASE JR. If you have EASE, you can also activate the Acoustical
Probe from the Walker control menu by clicking on the <i>Microphone </i>icon.
EASE users can by pressing the Lightning symbol button, also initiate a Ray
Tracing Impact study at the Walker location.<i> </i>For users having AURA, the
Aura button opens AURA for a monaural Impulse response study at the Walker
position.</p>
<p><b>Electro-Acoustic Calculations (Room Mapping)</b></p>
<p>The last stop on our quick overview of EASE will be the
Electro-Acoustic Simulation or Mapping portion of the program. EASE and EASE JR
offer two basic methods of displaying (mapping) the electro-acoustic
performance of the model and its loudspeaker system; Area Map-ping and Room
Mapping.</p>
<p>Room Mapping is accessible from either the Eyes rendering module
or from the Main window by selecting <i>Room Mapping</i> from the <i>Calcu-lations
</i>pull down menu. Since we are already in the Eyes module, we’ll start there.
The bottom row of Tool Bars in the Eyes window pro-vide direct access to the
mapping functions. First, use your mouse and the cursor to find the <i>Direct
SPL</i> button and then click on it. This will initiate the mapping routine by
bringing up the following setup window.</p>
<p>All EASE simulations are based upon a number of setup
parameters. For example, the program needs to know what loudspeakers will be
used and at what frequency the simulation should be run. The Mapping setup
window and the two that follow take you step by step through the points that
need to be considered. We’ll review all of the setup parameters in detail later
on in this tutorial. For now, since we are just taking a quick tour we’ll
accept most of the default settings.</p>
<p><img width=238 height=241
src="E1.files/image045.jpg"></p>
<p>The only change we need to make in this window is to select the
Loudspeakers we want to use. Clicking on the <i>Lsp</i>k button will bring up a
selection menu. Select <i>Main</i> and <i>OK</i>. We’ll use only the Main
loudspeaker in our example. If we wanted to use all the loud-speakers, right
clicking on <i>OK</i> in the selection window would have selected all of them.</p>
<p>Note that <i>All Mappings</i> is checked. When <i>All Mappings</i>
is turned on, the program will gather all the information it needs to map all
measures at all frequencies. When <i>Single</i> is checked, information for
only the selected measure at the chosen frequency is gathered. It takes only
slightly longer for All Mappings than for a Single map, so most users
automatically use All Mappings all the time.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Now press <i>Next</i> to open the second (Items) setup window.</p>
<p><img width=376 height=664
src="E1.files/image046.jpg"></p>
<p>The Items setup window is where the room elements that will be
used in the simulation are selected.</p>
<p>For our first simulation we want to map on all the Au-dience
Areas, so no changes are necessary in this window. All we need to do is to make
sure <i>On Areas</i> is checked in the <i>Mapping section</i> and all the <i>Audi-ence
Areas </i>are selected under<i> Audience Areas In Use</i>. Pressing the<i>
Audience Area </i>button will bring up<i> </i>a listing of all the Audience
Areas included in the model. All you need to do is to select all of them if
they aren’t already selected.</p>
<p>Note: If you turned Off the Audience Areas in the previous room
rendering exercise, you will need to go to the <i>Items</i> pull down menu and
turn them back On. EASE will not map on Audience Areas that are turned Off.</p>
<p>Press Next to advance to the Noise setup window, which allows
you to set the noise levels used in the intelligibility simulations. For now,
accept the default settings. We’ll cover this EASE feature in detail in the
Room Investigations section of this manual.</p>
<p>Press <i>Next</i> to advance to the Calculation setup win-dow
where the nature of the simulation is defined. Note that you have the
opportunity to map either with or without Shadowing and with either a Sinus
(single frequency) signal or in third octave bands.</p>
<p>Make sure <i>Map With Shadows</i> is selected. We want to see
how much of the main floor Audience Areas under the balcony is shadowed from
the Main Speaker by the balcony.</p>
<p>We’ll stick with the other settings for now. Click on <i>OK </i>to
start the simulation.</p>
<p>When the simulation is complete the program will map the results
on the Audience Areas and open a View Calculation window. Note that the View
Calcu-lation window blocks the main screen making it im-possible to see the
Audience Areas.</p>
<p><img width=379 height=221
src="E1.files/image047.jpg"></p>
<p>Minimize it by clicking on the Minimize Icon in the left corner
of the View Calculation window and then use your Mouse to drag it to a location
which allows you to see the mapping.</p>
<p>We’ll come back to the purpose of the Calculation window when we
get to the Room Investigations section of the manual.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>As you can see, the results of the simulation have been “mapped”
on the Audience Areas. The black section at the rear of the under balcony area
defines the area being shadowed from the main cluster by the balcony. The jagged
front edge of this area is a sign we maybe should have used a higher resolution
in this simulation. When “Patches” are used, EASE scans the area patch by patch
and had difficulty cal-culating these patches since part of the patch was being
shadowed and part wasn’t.</p>
<p><img width=399 height=232
src="E1.files/image048.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the Intelligibility. Since we used All
Mappings, all we have to do is go to minimized Calcu-lations window and use the
drop down arrow to change <i>Direct SPL</i> to <i>Articulation Loss</i>
(Alcons) and then press the bright colored Render Map icon. The Alcons map will
appear almost instantly; all EASE had to do was to render the map, it had
already done the calculations.</p>
<p>Notice the shadowed area under the balcony is red while
everything else is light green. In Alcons, light green is good while red
indicates the program was unable to calculate the articulation loss because of
the shadow.</p>
<p><img width=399 height=232
src="E1.files/image049.jpg"></p>
<p>Now let’s try mapping on the Room surfaces. First, go to the
menu bar, select <i>Items</i> and turn off the <i>Audi-ence Areas</i>. Then
press the<i> Waste Basket </i>icon in the<i> View Calculation </i>window to
waste the existing calcu-lation file and start a new calculation by pressing on
the <i>Direct SPL</i> icon. leave the first setup window un-changed. In the
second one, turn off <i>On Areas</i> and check <i>On Faces</i>. Next go to the <i>Faces
In Use</i> sec-tion, press the <i>Faces</i> button and select all the Faces.
Note that you have the option of choosing only a few of the Faces if that is
what you want. <i>OK</i> the setup and run the simulation.</p>
<p>Notice that the black area at the rear of the under bal-cony
area has disappeared and now there is one at the front of the balcony. The
floor at the rear of the under balcony area is not shadowed, even though the
ears of anyone seated there would be. In a similar fashion, listeners seated in
the front row of the bal-cony would not be shadowed by the face of the bal-cony
even though the floor under them would be.</p>
<p><img width=399 height=232
src="E1.files/image050.jpg"></p>
<p>Use the scroll bars and other viewing tools to turn and rotate
the room. Note the hot spot on the ceiling di-rectly over the cluster.</p>
<p>Note that EASE JR users will only be able to map Di-rect SPL in
Room Mapping. EASE users can map all the other simulations in Room Mapping, but
EASE JR users can’t.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Area Mapping</b></p>
<p>Area Mapping (it’s also called Standard Mapping) porvides the
same electro-acoustic measures as Room Mapping, eccept it displays them only on
the Audience Areas. The Direct SPL map shown below is identical to the one we
viewed in Room Mapping presented in a different fashion.</p>
<p><img width=605 height=436
src="E1.files/image051.jpg"></p>
<p>One advantage of Area Mapping is that the Audience Areas can be
moved around to eliminate one Audience Area from partially overlap-ping or
completely blocking your view of another Audience Area. In this graphic, for
example, the Balcony Audience Area (the Audience Area at the bottom of the
screen) has been moved so it does not overlap any portion of the two main floor
Audience Areas.</p>
<p>Moving the Audience Areas is accomplished in the Edit Project
module. To see how it works, go back to the Edit Project window and select <i>Area
Layout </i>from the<i> Edit </i>pull down menu. Then select<i> Move </i>from
the<i> Edit </i>pull down menu and move the Audience Areas around by grab-bing
them with the pliers tool. It’s easy to do.</p>
<p>Without the normal 3D view it’s easy to lose track of which
Audience Area is which. To prevent this most users give them a name when they
are created and turn on the Audience Area Labels when they are using Area
Mapping. Use your cursor to find the A<i>udience Areas</i> <i>Labe</i>l icon in
the tool bar section and turn the labels<i> On</i>.</p>
<p>While running these simulations you may have noticed that there
have been colors in some of the renderings that did not appear in the Color
Legend chart at the side of the screen. The reason is that the Color Legend
chart has a range of only 20 dB while the range of the display is much greater.
If this presents a problem for you, go to the <i>View</i> tab in the <i>Options</i>
menu (right click on the screen and select <i>Op-tions </i>or hit<i> F9 </i>and
then select the<i> View </i>tab). Check<i> Auto Show Legends Window </i>and hit<i>
Apply </i>to insert a color legend with a scroll bar that<i> </i>enables you to
identify all the colors. If you want to use this one instead of the one with a
limited range, uncheck <i>Auto Show Legends</i> and leave <i>Auto Show Legends
Window</i> selected. Then click on <i>OK</i>. Note that this same folder gives
you control of the Parameters usually shown in the upper left corner of the
screen.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Be aware that if you turn off these item’s auto insert commands
in the Option folder you can still manually insert them by going to the <i>Utili-ties
</i>pull down menu and clicking on the appropriate command.</p>
<p>Let’s do one more simulation before we move on to building a
model. This time let’s take a close look at the balcony coverage being
pro-vided by the three Delay loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Click on the <i>Recalculate Map</i> icon (it’s the explanation
point symbol at the left end of the lower tool bar section) to initiate a new
calcula-tion. In the opening setup window you’ll need to change from the Main
Loudspeaker to the three Delay loudspeakers. Click on one of the Delay
loudspeakers and then hold down the <i>Ctrl</i> key while you select the other
two. Press <i>Next</i>. In the second setup window you will need to turn Off
all the Audience Areas except for the Balcony Audience Area. Make the change
and hit <i>OK</i> to start the simulation.</p>
<p>The resultant Map may be a little difficult to interpret, so
lets try mapping in Isolines instead of by by Patches. Find the Isolines Icon
in the tool bar section (it’s just to the right of the STI icon) and click on
it. EASE will then redraw the Map in Isolines which may be a little easier to
read. The Isoline Map is shown below.</p>
<p><img width=600 height=427
src="E1.files/image052.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice the interference pattern between the three delay line
loudspeakers. Investigate it by turning and rotating the graphic to get a
better view.</p>
<p>If you have time, rerun the simulation using Sinus and
one-octave signals and note the differences. Try other combinations, too, to
get a feel for this portion of the program.</p>
