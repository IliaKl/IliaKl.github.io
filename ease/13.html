<p><b>Section 13: IR Infrared</b></p>
<p>The IR Infrared module allows the performance of Infrared
systems to be simulated and analyzed in much the same fashion as Loud-speaker
systems and their performance are simulated and analyzed.</p>
<p>We will use the AURA1 room model as our room model. You will
find it in the Projects 40 folder under EASE40 Data. It's identified as AURA1.
Open the model and then select <i>Project Data</i> from the <i>Edi</i>t pull
down menu.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E4.files/image081.jpg"></p>
<p>Our first step will be to add the IR Emitters to the model.
First, though, a few words about IR Emitters. An IR Emitter consists of a
Modula-tor and a Radiator.</p>
<p><b>Modulators </b>determine the type of transmission (broad
band or narrow band), the carrier frequency and the number of channels.</p>
<p><b>Radiators </b>determine the coverage pattern and signal
level.</p>
<p>Modulators and Radiators may be packaged as two separate devices
or combined into a single unit. EASE, however, manages the data of modulators,
radiators and combined units as separate files.</p>
<p>IR Emitters are inserted into a model in the same fashion as
Loudspeakers, but the rules for placement are different. Infrared is strictly
line-of-sight transmission between the Radiator and the Receiver(s). Typically
Radiators are mounted as high as possible to prevent obstruc-tions, such as
those seated in the row ahead of the listener, from interfering with the
transmission. When more than one Radiatior is needed to provide adequate
coverage, it's common to split them (place them a distance apart) and
cross-fire the signal. This improves the likelihood that the signal from at
least one of the Radiators will reach the Receiver.</p>
<p>The interference caused by cross-firing and overlapping coverage
has a positive effect in Infrared systems and not a negative effect as it
usually has in loudspeaker systems.</p>
<p><b>Inserting IR Emitters</b></p>
<p>To insert an IR Emitter click on the <i>Insert IR Emitter</i>
button in the Tool Bar or go to the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and click on <i>IR
Emitter</i>. Then, click on any spot in the room. This will open the IR Emitter
Properties window shown at the top of the next page.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>Chapter 13: IR Infrared</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=286
src="E4.files/image082.jpg"></p>
<p>The first step is to correct the location of the Emitter by
entering the correct x, y, z coor-dinates under Location. Let's assume that our
plan is to install two Emitters, one on each side of the stage and fairly close
to the ceiling. Enter -31 as the x coordinate, 10 for y and 35 for z.</p>
<p>Note that if we knew the aiming angles, we could enter them
under View Angle. We don't know them, so we'll wait and use the Aiming feature
after we have finished defin-ing the Emitter.</p>
<p>The next step is to assign the corresponding devices (
Modulators and Radiators) to the IR Emitter. We'll start with the Modulator.
which determines the carrier frequency of the signal transmission as well as
the number of transmission channels. Click on the <i>[.]</i> button to the
right of the Modulator Model text field to open the Choose Modulator win-dow.</p>
<p><img width=218 height=264
src="E4.files/image083.jpg"></p>
<p>Click on <i>Browse</i> and use conventional browsing techniques
to locate the E<i>ASE40Data/</i> <i>IR Devices/IR Sennheiser </i>folder. Open
it, click on<i> Select All</i>, then<i> Add&gt;&gt; </i>and then press<i> OK</i>.</p>
<p>This will return you to the Choose Modulator window. Let's use
the Sennheiser SI1015, a broad-band, two-channel modulator. It will give us
full range, 20 Hz to 20 kHz stereo performance. Narrow-band, multiple channel
modulators are used mainly for speech in simultaneous interpretation systems.</p>
<p>Select the <i>SI1015</i> and click on <i>OK</i>. Next, click on <i>Select</i>
in the Modulator section of the Properties window and select both frequencies.
We want to reproduce a stereo signal, so we'll need to use both channels.</p>
<p><img width=216 height=262
src="E4.files/image084.jpg"></p>
<p>Follow the same procedure to assign the IR Radiator, but be sure
to use only a Radiator that is compatible with the SI1015 Modulator. We'll use
the SZI1029.</p>
<p>The cable length between the Modulator and Radiator is important
when the Radiator is at a great distance from the Modulator and when multiple
Radiators are used and the cable lengths vary. For this exercise, let's assume
the lengths will be the same for both Radiators and enter 50 in the <i>Cable
Length</i> field. Click on <i>OK</i> to accept the settings and close the
Properties window.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>The AURA1 model we chose to use was not in the Symmetrical
modeling mode so only one IR Emitter was placed in the model. We also know from
earlier Tutorial lessons that it’s not a good idea to try to go back to the
Symmetrical modeling mode once you have exited it. So, follow the same
procedure to insert the second Emitter or use Duplicate/Displace to insert it
and then displace it by 62 feet. Pick the first Emitter and then right click on
the screen to open the Mouse menu, select <i>Duplicate</i> and then insert 62
in the x field of the Displace screen.</p>
<p>Now, lets aim the Radiator portion of the Emitter. Pick it, if
it isn't selected, and then right click to open the Mouse Menu. Select IR
Emitter Aiming and the Aiming screen shown below will appear. Just click on the
screen to reaim the Radiator. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Notice that the Horizontal and Vertical aiming angles are
displayed at the bottom of the screen. Make note of these as you'll want the
sec-ond Radiator aimed to the same spot on the other side of the room. Hint; we
ended up with 50 degrees horizontal and -25 degrees vertical for IR1.</p>
<p><img width=533 height=387
src="E4.files/image085.jpg"></p>
<p>Then repeat the procedure with IR2.</p>
<p><b>Calculations</b></p>
<p>Now its time to see how the system performs. Ease allows you to
calculate an IR signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio in dB) for each channel as a
function of distance and carrier frequency for Listener Seats and Audience
Areas under Area Mapping and for Listener Seats, Audience Areas and Faces under
Room Mapping. Interference and shadowing effects can be included in the
simulation.</p>
<p>Reflections are not included and the simulation will be made with
only direct radiation considered. Reflections are not included since
insuf-ficient data exists on the Infrared reflection characteristics of of
surface materials. Fortunately, reflections improve the signal-to-noise ratio
which makes the simulation results conservative.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 13: IR Infrared</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>The mapping routine for IR simulations is very similar to the
routine used for Loudspeakers. Press <i>F5</i> to <i>Check Data</i> and then
switch to the Ease Main Window and open the <i>Area Mapping</i> module. (Click
on <i>Area Mapping</i> in the <i>Calculations</i> pull down menu.)</p>
<p>When the Area Mapping window opens, the first thing you will
notice is that the Main floor Audience Area is obscuring the Balcony Audi-ence
Area. The designer forgot to move one of the Audience Areas so this wouldn't
happen. No problem, return to the Edit Project module and select <i>Area Layou</i>t
from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu. Then select <i>Move</i> from the <i>Edit</i>
pull down menu and grab the Main Floor Audience Area and move it out of the
way.</p>
<p>Return to the Area Mapping window and click on <i>IR Simulation</i>
in the <i>Mapping</i> pull down menu and the first of three IR Simulation
dialog windows will open.shown below will open.</p>
<p><img width=282 height=237
src="E4.files/image086.jpg"></p>
<p>Select the IR Emitters that will be used in the calculation by
clicking on the IR Emitter button and then selecting both IR Emitters.</p>
<p>You will probably also want to reduce the patch Size; change it
from 3.28 to 1.</p>
<p>Then press the <i>Next</i> button to move to the second
(Set-tings) tab.</p>
<p><img width=282 height=237
src="E4.files/image087.jpg"></p>
<p>The Settings tab determine which Audience Areas or Listener
Seats will be included in the simulation. Select both Audience Areas and then
press the <i>Next</i> button to move to the third (Calculations) tab.</p>
<p><img width=282 height=237
src="E4.files/image088.jpg"></p>
<p>Make sure both the <i>Interference Sum</i> and <i>Map with</i> <i>Shadow
</i>boxes are checked. We do want to take interfer-ence and shadowing into
account in our simulation.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that we did not insert a Noise Level figure in the <i>Noise
Level [dB]</i> field. Little data exists on how the two primary types of
interfer-ence affect the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Unmodulated
Interference, such as the interference caused by daylight and stage lighting
which have their own Infrared component, can wash out the signal.</p>
<p>Modulated Interference, the interference caused by light
dimmers, fluorescent light and electronic ballasts introduce buzz and static
into the system.</p>
<p>The Noise Level [dB] field was included so that when data
becomes available it can be entered into the program and included in the
signal-to-noise calculation.</p>
<p>When you are ready to start the simulation, click on <i>OK</i>.
When the View Calculation Window opens minimize it so you can see the map-ping
display.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=316
src="E4.files/image089.jpg"></p>
<p>As a general rule, ratios of 50 dB or higher are considered
good; levels of 40 dB to 50 dB are marginal and lower levels are probably not
acceptable.</p>
<p>Our map dips below below 50 in the corners of the balcony, so
lets try reaiming the Emitters.</p>
<p>Return to Edit Project and change the vertical aiming angles on
the two IR Emitters from -25 to -20. <i>Check Data [F5]</i> and then return to
the Mapping window. Click on <i>Acquire Project Data</i> in the <i>File</i>
pull down menu and answer <i>Yes</i> to the prompts that appear to rerun the
simula-tion. You will see that this improved the performance.</p>
<p>To try other aiming angles return to the Edit Project window,
change the aiming angles, Check Data and then return to the Mapping mod-ule.</p>
<p>We tried again and ended up using 45 for the Horizontal angle
and -18 for the Vertical Angle.The result appears at the top of the next page.</p>
<p>Note that now the coverage is above 50 throughout the Audience
Areas.</p>

<p>We touched earlier on the importance of cable length. Let's
explore this further by adding 100 feet to the length of the cable to one of
the Radiators.</p>
<p>Return to the Edit Project window, select one of the IR Emitters
and then right click to open the Mouse Menu. Open the Properties folder and
increase the cable length by 100 feet. Click on <i>OK</i> and then press <i>F5</i>
to Check Data.</p>
<p>Return to the Area Mapping window, click on <i>Acquire Project
Data</i> in the and follow the prompts to rerun the simulation.</p>
<p>As you can see, cable length is important.</p>

<p><b>Creating New IR Devices</b></p>
<p>Adding new IR devices to the IR database file is a relatively
simple procedure.</p>
<p>To establish new IR modulator and IR radiator files go to the <i>File</i>
pull down menu in the Ease Main win-dow. Then click on <i>IR Sources</i> in the
Main Data Bases submenu. This will open the IR Base module.</p>
<p>To add a new IR device, select <i>New</i> <i>Device </i>from the<i>
File </i>pull down<i> </i>menu.</p>
<p>This will open a Create New Device dialog box.</p>
<p><img width=248 height=240
src="E4.files/image093.jpg"></p>
<p>Choose the type of device (Radiator, Modulator or
Modulator/Radiator Combined ) and then click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p><b>Radiators</b></p>
<p>We'll start with a Radiator, so put a check in the radio button
in front of <i>Radiator </i>and hit<i> OK</i>.</p>
<p>Now, open the Edit pull down menu. You'll see that only three of
the five selections are active, Radiator Model, Radiator Data and Attenua-tion
Data. If we had checked Modu-lator in the previous operation, only Modulator
Model, Modulator Data and Attenuation would be active. Selecting
Modulator/Radiator Com-bined would have turned all five items active.</p>
<p><img width=202 height=313
src="E4.files/image094.jpg"></p>
<p>We'll start by selecting <i>Radiator</i></p>
<p><i>Model. </i>This will open the screen</p>
<p>shown to the right.</p>
<p>Enter the model number of the de-vice in the Radiator Model
field and the name of the manufacturer in the Manufacturer field. Note that if
we were entering a combined Radia-tor/Modulator it would be necessary to check <i>Modulator
Integrated</i>. Click on <i>OK</i> to confirm the data and close the window.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>Chapter 13: IR Infrared</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Now return to the Edit pull down menu and select <i>Radiator
Data</i>. This will open</p>
<p><img width=266 height=402
src="E4.files/image095.jpg"></p>
<p>the Radiator Data screen.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The only Radiator Data parameter that is actually needed by the
program to complete the simulation calculations is the number of IR diodes. All
the other data is included only for information. Enter the number of diodes in
the <i>IR</i> <i>Diodes Number </i>field</p>
<p>After you have finished entering the data, click on <i>Compute
Sensitivity [dB]</i> to initiate the calculation of a characteristic radiation
level.</p>
<p>This is the level of the signal-to-noise ratio at a distance of
1 m without consid-eration of the directivity characteristic. The
characteristic radiation level is calcu-lated according to:</p>
<p><img width=241 height=111
src="E4.files/image096.jpg"></p>
<p>n<sub>D</sub> = number of diodes</p>
<p>L<sub>D</sub> = diode capacity</p>
<p>0,2141 sr Radiation angle = +/- 15 °</p>
<p><img width=22 height=34
src="E4.files/image097.jpg"></p>
<p>Correction factor for the diode capacity, the specified value is
for a supply with 100 mA c.a.</p>
<p>The actual supply, however, is with 90 mA c.a. (in devices of
the Sennheiser Company)</p>
<p>Note that the radiation capacity of the diode is not variable
and is fixed at 15 mW (according to the the specifications of the diodes used
by Sennheiser in their IR devices) .The set-up for level calculation was
derived from the available measured data. Click on <i>OK</i> to confirm the
data and close the window.</p>
<p><img width=324 height=303
src="E4.files/image098.jpg"></p>
<p>Now click on <i>Attenuation Data</i> in the <i>Edit</i> menu to
open the Attenua-tion Data window. The table contained in the window is used to
enter the directional attenuation data of the radiator. All values are in the
minus dB scale (level of signal-to-noise ratio). The level at 0.0 degree
(normally the main axis) is normalized with 0 dB and all other meas-urements
are derived from this point. However, the numbers may be entered without a
minus sign as the program assumes that all attenu-ation values are negative.</p>
<p>The chart shows the polars in line values from 0 degree to 180
de-grees. 0 is on the axis in front of the radiator and 180 is looking at the
rear of the radiator. Visualize this as a wedge or a slice of an orange. The
column angles from 0 degree to 355 degrees take the slice and tilt it 5
degrees. 0 degree corresponds to the left half of the horizontal polars and 180
to the right half. At 90 degrees the visible half of the polars corresponds to
the upper vertical half and at 270 degrees we see the lower vertical half.</p>
<p>It is also possible to enter only the horizontal and vertical
polar data. Enter the data, then select <i>Compute Elliptical Lobe</i> from the
<i>Data</i> pull down menu. EASE will then calculate all the other data points
by means of an elliptical lobe algorithm.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Apply</i> in the Data window will store the Data. <i>Exit</i>
will store the Data and close the window.</p>

<p><b>Modulators</b></p>
<p><img width=202 height=314
src="E4.files/image099.jpg"></p>
<p>Now click on <i>Modulator Model</i> in the <i>Edit</i> menu to
open the Modulator Model window.</p>
<p>Notice that this window is similar to the Radiator Model window.
Enter the manufacturer's name and the model number and, if you are entering a
combined Radiator/Modulator check <i>Radiator Integrated</i>. Then click on <i>OK
</i>to confirm the data and close the window.</p>
<p>Next, click on <i>Modulator Data</i> in the Edit menu, and the
Modulator Data window will open.</p>
<p>The program actually needs only the four following parameters
for its simulations. The other data is included only for information.</p>
<p>-the type of modulation, broad band (wide) or narrow band (narrow)
Note that narrow band modulation is usually used only for multi-channel
systems, such as those used for simultaneous interpreta-tion systems.</p>
<p>-the maximum carrier frequency (Max. RF Channel)</p>
<p><img width=238 height=355
src="E4.files/image100.jpg"></p>
<p>-the minimum carrier frequency (Min. RF Channel)</p>
<p>-and the number of channels (RF Channels Number)</p>
<p>Notice that the program will allow only two wide band channels.</p>
<p>Click on <i>OK</i> to confirm the data and close the window.</p>
<p>The last step is to save and store the entered data in the Ease
IR Radia-tor/Modulator files.</p>
<p>Click on <i>Save Device As</i> in the File menu of the IR Base
main window.</p>
<p>The dialog box that pops up shows the name of the device as a
standard file name.</p>
<p>The radiator data and the
modulator data are stored in files with the ex-tensions .irr and .irm,
respectively. With combined units, only the name of the radiator file is given.
The modulator file is stored under the same name</p>
