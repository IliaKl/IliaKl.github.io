<p>All the
Mapping functions we reviewed in Room Investigations are avail-able in both
EASE and EASE JR. <b>Now, it's time to move on to simula-tions that are
available only to EASE users.</b></p>
<p><b>Local
Decay Times</b></p>
<p>EASE
4.3 has the ability to quickly develop RT Times based on reflection studies.
The Eyring or Sabine formulas EASE JR and EASE use to calcu-late RT times are
generalized formulas that don't apply to every room.</p>
<p>For
example, they assume the room's absorption material is distributed
homogeneously on the room's surfaces, a condition that doesn't exist in every
room. The RT Times are also a single set of times for the entire room while in
real life the RT Times from one location to another.</p>
<p><i>Local
Decay Time </i>provides a quick check on the accuracy of these for-mulas, as
well as providing RT projections for specific points within the room. It uses
an omnidirectional source to distribute Rays throughout the room and calculates
the RT Time from their decay. The result is RT Times that are more &quot;real
life&quot; figures.</p>
<p><img
width=291 height=291 src="E3.files/image096.jpg"></p>
<p>Select <i>Local
Decay Times</i> is accessed in either Area Mapping or Room Mapping from the <i>Mapping</i>
pull down menu. We used Area Mapping which opened the Calculation Parameters’
setup window shown here. Note that it is similar to the one we have been using
in Area Mapping, but doesn't have a Loudspeaker selection section. The reason
is that the sys-tem loudspeakers won't be used to calculate the Local Decay
Times. In-stead an omnidirectional source will be used. This simulation is
interested only in the room's decay times.</p>
<p>Press <i>Next</i>
to bring up the second setup window which also should look familiar.</p>
<p>Note
that you have a choice of Mapping on Seats or Areas or both. Al-though you can
map on Areas, we suggest Mapping on only the Seats. Mapping on Areas will take
a considerable amount of time because of the number of points involved, which
defeats our objective of doing a quick check. Select <i>Seat</i>s and then use
the <i>List Seat</i> button to select all 5 of the Listener Seats.</p>
<p><img
width=291 height=291 src="E3.files/image097.jpg"></p>
<p>Now,
press <i>Next</i> to open the Noise setup window; accept the default set-tings
and press <i>Next</i> to move on to the Calculation setup window.</p>
<p>We
suggest using the Default settings. Using more Rays or a larger Re-flection
Order would yield more precise figures, but we are just looking for a quick
check and the default settings will be adequate.</p>
<p>The
results are shown in the screen on the next page.</p>

of the 5 Seats. Note the variance from Seat to Seat.</p>
<p>The

<p><b>Standard
Mapping With Reflections</b></p>
<p>Standard
Mapping uses a statistical formula to calcu-late reflected sound levels from
the Direct Sound lev-els and the RT Times developed by either the Eyring or
Sabine formulas. <i>Standard With Reflections</i> (avail-able under the Mapping
pull down menu in either Area Mapping or Room Mapping) replaces the generalized
Eyring or Sabine generated RT times with RT times developed by Ray Tracing. It
is a more accurate method, but the calculations take considerable more time.
How much more time depends on the complex-ity of the room, the number of
loudspeakers involved, the number of Rays you choose to use, the Reflection
Order you select and the speed of your computer.</p>
<p><img
width=390 height=223 src="E3.files/image100.jpg"></p>
<p>Selecting
<i>Standard With Reflections</i> will initiate the fa-miliar four Calculation
setup windows plus a fifth Ray Tracing setup window. If you decide to try it
out so you can compare the results with those obtained with Standard Mapping,
click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Two
status windows will appear to keep you advised</p>
<p>of the
status of the calculations. Note that the total</p>
<p>time is
well over 3 hours. You may want to consider</p>
<p>using
just a few Seats instead of all the Audience</p>
<p>Areas.</p>

<p><b>Local
Ray Tracing</b></p>
<p>Local
Ray Tracing allows you to quickly take a more in-depth look at various spots
around the room than Local Decay Times.</p>
<p>Like
Local Decay Times, Local Ray Tracing can be ac-cessed from either Area Mapping
or Room Mapping. Select <i>Local Ray Tracing</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull
down menu. Then click on a spot in one of the Audience Areas to establish the
location of the Walker (Probe if you entered from Area Mapping). This will open
a Ray Tracing setup window.</p>
<p><img
width=391 height=223 src="E3.files/image102.jpg"></p>
<p>Accept
the default settings and click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>This
will open a file name/location dialog window. As-sign a file name and click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>The
default settings of 1000 Rays per Loudspeaker and 3rd Order reflections are
fine to provide a quick snap shot of what's happening at the chosen location.
Far more Rays per Loudspeaker and much higher re-flection orders would be
needed for a detailed investi-gation. The results of our 3rd Order study are
shown in the following Reflectrogram.</p>
<p><img
width=534 height=385 src="E3.files/image103.jpg"></p>
<p>The red
pulses represent direct sound and the green pulses represent the reflections
that were picked up in the simulation. Note that click-ing on any pulse
produces a readout giving the exact level and arrival time.</p>
<p>Local
Ray Tracing also offers a number of other interesting displays, including MTF
and STI. Check them out using the Tool Bar icons or the Graphs pull down menu.</p>

<p><img

<p><b>Ray 
Tracing Impacts (Find Impacts)</b></p>
<p><i>Find
Impacts </i>is a Ray Tracing option that registers rays that pass within a
meter of the chosen point (impact upon a 1 meter counting bal-loon), stores the
results and then automatically runs a mirror image routine to identify the
impacts that hit the center of the counting bal-loon. <i>Find Impacts</i>
requires a larger number of rays (100,000 or more in many cases) and higher
reflection orders than Local Ray Tracing. It relies upon the laws of
probability to identify an adequate number of impacts to ensure an acceptable
degree of accuracy. The computa-tional time is proportional to the number of
Faces; i.e., doubling the number of Faces doubles the time required. <i>Find
Impact</i> results are suitable for detailed acoustical investigations and EARS
auralizations.</p>
<p>From
the Main window, select <i>Ray Tracing</i> from the <i>Calculations</i> pull
down menu. Then select <i>Ray Tracing Impacts</i> from the <i>Rays</i> pull down
menu to open the initial <i>Find Impacts</i> set up menu shown below. Notice
that many of the choices are similar to the ones found under Ray Tracing.</p>
<p><img
width=327 height=204 src="E3.files/image104.jpg"></p>
<p>The
four buttons at the top allow you to select the Loudspeakers and Listeners
Seats that will be used in the study.</p>
<p>Keep in
mind the difference between Ray Tracing and Impact Studies is that Impact
Studies investigate only the Rays that hit (impact) a specific target, a 1
meter counting balloon surrounding the Listeners Seat. <i>Ray Tracing</i> does
not record impacts. <i>Find Impact</i> does. To save time in this exercise,
we’ll use the 5 Listeners Seats and only the Main loudspeaker and three Delay
loudspeakers.</p>
<p>The
search options are similar to the ones we explored under Ray Tracing, but now
we want to make an Impact file. Put a check in <i>Make</i> <i>Impact file</i>.
We could check<i> Brief Impact Info </i>and<i> Draw Impact Ray </i>but they
would not add much information to the simulation and would<i> </i>lengthen the
calculation time. The next step is to decide upon the length of the simulation.</p>
<p>A
general rule for producing good Impact files in a reasonable period of
calculation time is that the Room's <i>Mean Free Path Time</i> times the <i>Reflection
Order </i>should be approximately equal to the<i> Time Frame</i>. The<i> Mean
Free Path Time </i>for Theater 1 can be found in the Room<i> </i>Data folder.
(Open the Project Data module, right click on the screen and then select <i>Room
Data</i> from the Mouse Menu.)</p>
<p>It is
.03 sec. This means that if we want to use a Reflection Order of 10, the Time
Frame should be approximately 300 msec. Put a check in <i>Time (ms)</i> and
enter 300 into the <i>Time (ms)</i> field. Then <i>OK</i> the setup.</p>
<p>The
setup screen shown below will appear. Put a check in the Order selection box and
Insert 10 into the Order field.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice
that this menu is identical to the one we worked with under Ray Tracing, except
for having an <i>Impact Chance</i> field added. EASE will review our setup
parameters and use the <i>Impact Chance</i> field to tell us what the odds are
of registering all of the possible impacts. Ob-viously, the higher the
percentage the more accurate the simulation.</p>
<p>Notice
that the program entered a higher (longer) figure into the <i>Time</i> window
than the one we entered in the previous menu. The previous figure defined the
time frame from the first Impact. The figure shown in this menu also includes
the time from when the first Ray is gener-ated to its first Impact. We'll use
the 375 msec figure and start with an <i>Order</i> count of 10 and 100 <i>Rays
per Loudspeaker</i>.</p>
<p>You'll
notice the Impact Chance is quite small, so increase the number of Rays per
Loudspeaker to 10,000 and then to 50,000. It takes a lot of Rays to get the
Impact Chance over 50 %. 50% is not good enough for an auralization, so try
150,000 rays. This will improve the Im-pact Chance to almost 90%..</p>
<p>Notice
that we did not check Make Trace File or Draw Trace Rays. Our objective is to
make an Impact File and creating a Trace File or drawing the Trace Rays at the
same time only significantly lengthens the computation time without serving any
real purpose. We also did not check Directed Emission. Directed Emissions
produces a weighted display that is used primarily to enhance Movie
presentations.</p>
<p>We did,
however, put a check in the <i>Brief Ray Info</i> box. This tells the program
to flash brief information on each Ray and its color in the Ray Tracing control
screen. Yellow indicates the Ray was cut off by the Time Frame before it
impacted upon the Listener Seat. Magenta indi-cates that the cutoff was caused
by the Reflection Order limitation. Blue Rays are ones that Impact upon the
Listener Seat. During the sim-ulation, the Rays flash by so quickly you
probably won't be able to see the blue flashes, but you should see a good mix
of Yellow and Magenta flashes. If you only see Yellow, it's a sign that the
Time Frame may be to short. All Magenta flashes indicates the Reflection Order
probably should be higher.</p>
<p>Clicking
on <i>OK</i> will introduce a prompt reminding you the Impact Chance is less
than 100%.</p>
<p>Acknowledging
the prompt by clicking on <i>OK</i> will open a new window giving you the
opportunity to name the File and its destination. The simulation will start
after you have entered this information and approved it by clicking on <i>OK</i>.
Notice that after the simulation starts you will be given the approximate
length of time the simulation will require. It will be significant. On our 2
GHz machine the estimate was just under 1 1/2 hours. A 50,000 Ray study would
have taken about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>During
the simulation, an informational box will keep you up to date on the progress
of the study and the amount of time left.</p>

<p>When
the simulation is complete, the .log screen shown below will open partially
obscuring the Ray Control window. It records the parame-ters used for the
simulation and summarizes the results in text form. If you want, you can print
or save this information for future reference.</p>
<p><img

<p>The

you. As you can see from the screen shown below, over 8600 impacts were
recorded. Note that the summary also tabulates the Impacts by their Order.</p>
<p>A

<p><b>Acoustical

<p>Pressing
the <i>Invoke Prob</i>e button opens the Probe acoustical analysis program

<p><img
width=150 height=287 src="E3.files/image111.jpg"></p>
<p>Remember,
we created the <i>Impact File</i> using only the Main and Delay loudspeakers.
It's possible you might want to turn some of them Off to get a better look at
the effect of using, for example, just the main floor loudspeakers. We will use
all of them as we want to see the full system's performance.</p>
<p>As soon
as the Loudspeaker selection is approved by clicking on <i>OK</i>, another
prompt will appear asking for your <i>Seat</i> selection. You will be allowed
to select only one <i>Listener Seat</i> from those listed even if more than one
Listener Seat was included in the Impact study. Remem-ber, the object of this
investigation is to see what's happening at a specific spot.</p>
<p>It
should be noted here that including all 5 Listener Seats in our Impact study
instead of a single Seat did not increase the calculation time by a factor of
five. Instead, it only increased the time by about 50%. Most experienced users
will run their Impact studies on at least several strategically located
Listener Seats at one time. They will also schedule their activities so the
simulation can be run while they are doing something else, such as having
lunch.</p>

<p>Selecting
<i>Seat 5</i> and approving the selection by clicking <i>OK</i> will start the
process. When it is completed, a Reflectogram similar to the one shown below
will appear. Don't expect the Reflectogram to appear instantly. EASE has a lot
of data to review before it draws the Reflec-togram and it may take a minute or
two. Be patient.</p>
<p><img
width=577 height=416 src="E3.files/image112.jpg"></p>
<p>Now use
your Mouse and the Cursor to select one of the Impact Pulses and introduce a
readout on the screen showing the exact arrival time of that reflection and its
exact level. Note that if you use your right Mouse button to select the Pulse,
the program will write the same information on the screen.</p>
<p>Next,
click on the <i>Pick</i> icon in the Tool Bar section and then click on another
one of the Impact Pulses. Notice that the status bar below the Reflectogram now
gives you the number of the Pulse you selected, its origination point, time of arrival,
energy level, reflection order and ar-rival direction. This is all information
that EASE has stored on every impact for each of the 21 frequency bands.</p>
<p>To
check this out, click on the <i>Frequency</i> icon and choose a new frequency.
The program will then quickly redraw the Reflectogram for the new frequency. If
you want to look more closely at a certain section of the Reflectogram, use the
<i>F11</i> key stroke to Zoom In on the window or the Zoom icon and cursor to
Zoom in on a section of the Reflectogram.</p>
<p>Select
one of the Impact Pulses again and then minimize the Reflectogram and return to
the View Impact File control window, select the Ray tab. Note that the control
window identifies the Impact Pulse you selected, traces its patch Face by Face
and gives you the Arrival time and level. The View Project window also traces
the Impact Pulse’s path.</p>
<p>You can
also view the reflections by <i>Reflection Order</i>. Go to the <i>View</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Reflection Orde</i>r. Then select the <i>Order</i>
you want to see, 3 for 3rd Order for example. EASE will now highlight all the
3rd Order Reflections. You can easily view other Reflection Orders by using <i>Ctrl</i>
- or <i>Ctrl +</i> keystrokes to move to a lower or higher Order.</p>

<p>The <i>Waterfall</i>
is another interesting display. It's accessible by clicking on its tool bar
icon or through the Graph pull down menu. You'll find it under <i>Time Response</i>.
What makes the Waterfall interesting is that it shows at a glance the energy
level and arrival time for each impact at each of the 21 frequencies.</p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image113.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that you can Zoom in on it to get a better view of a specific section and that
you can also select any one of the Impulses by clicking on it. You most likely
will notice that as you switch from one presentation screen to another, the
Pulse selection follows making it easy to look at a particular pulse in several
different ways.</p>
<p>The <i>3-D
Hedgehog</i> display shown below provides another interesting view. It shows
the Pulse Directionality in a distinctive fashion. The 3-D Hedgehog display can
be accessed either by clicking on its tool bar icon or in the <i>Graphs</i>
pull down menu under <i>Pulse Directionality</i>.</p>
<p>You
probably also noticed two other listings in the Pulse Directionality menu, <i>Horizontal</i>
and <b>Vertica</b>l. Selecting these produces vertical and horizontal views of
the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>Two
more important EASE displays are the <i>Impulse Response (IR)</i> display and <i>Energy
Time Curve (ETC</i>). EASE calculates the Impulse Response by convolving all 21
of the 1/3 octave band reflectograms with a Unity Sphere. This produces a
monaural IR you could measure in real life with an omnispherical microphone. To
look at the Impulse Response, click on the <i>IR (Impulse Response)</i> icon in
the tool bar or use the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu and select <i>Time
Response/Impulse Response.</i></p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image115.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Energy
Time Curve (ETC)</i> is developed by squaring and transforming the IR signal.
Click on the <i>Show ETC</i> icon or use the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu and
select <i>Time Response</i>.</p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image116.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Frequency
Response</i> curve shown on the next page is available by going to the <i>Graphs</i>
pull down menu or by clicking on its tool bar icon. As you see, it shows both
the 1/3 octave average energy levels and the detailed response curve. Also
notice that you are looking at an A weighted curve. An unweighted curve can be
obtained by going to the <i>Frq.Rsp</i> section of the <i>Options</i> folder
and removing the check in the <i>Levels in db (A)</i> box. Use the <i>Appl</i>y
button to see the difference A weighting makes.</p>

<p>You
probably noticed a number of deep dips in the response curve. To find out how
deep these are, select the <i>Pick</i> tool and then click on the response
curve. This will turn the cursor into crosshairs that can be moved along the
response curve with the right and left arrow keys. Let's check out the one that
appears to be slightly below 3000 Hz. You'll find out the hole is actually at
2806 Hz and is over 30 dB deep.</p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image117.jpg"></p>
<p>Another
useful EASE feature is the use of MTF's (Modulation Transfer Functions) as a
basis for high accuracy intelligibility predictions. The program uses the seven
averaged frequency dependent octave band Impulse Responses to calculate by
means of 14 modulation frequen-cies the MTI values. From these, EASE derives
the MTF curves and the STI (Speech Transmission Index) for Standard (average),
Male, and Female speech. To initiate this function, click on the <i>Show MTF</i>
icon or go to the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu, select <i>Expectation Values</i>
and then <i>MTF/STI</i>. A typical MTF/STI display appears below.</p>
<p><img

<p>The
calculated STI figures appear at the top of the screen; STI is the average
figure, M is for Male speech and F is female speech.</p>

under the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu.</p>
<p>You are
able to step through all of these presentations one by one by using the Arrow
icons in the Tool Bar.</p>
<p><b>RT
Displays &amp; Schroeder RT</b></p>
<p>Our
review of Probe functions wouldn't be complete without looking into the RT
displays. Selecting <i>Reverberation Time</i> from the <i>Reverber-ation </i>section
under the<i> Graphs </i>pull down menu will draw the RT curve calculated using
the<i> “Provided Formula”</i>; the last RT Curve we<i> </i>looked at. In our
case, it will probably be the Local Decay Time we looked at in the Room
Investigations section of this Tutorial.</p>
<p>Then
open the <i>Options</i> menu (hit <i>F9</i> or right click on the screen and
select Options from the Mouse menu) and open the Rev. Time tab.</p>
<p><img
width=461 height=376 src="E3.files/image119.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Replace
by</i> section will change the display of the figures in the RT display for the
chosen RT formula and then use these figures in any future Probe calculations
using RT times. If <i>Schroeder</i> is chosen, the program will also calculate
the RT time based on Schroeder's reverse integration formula and the
Reflectogram's energy levels.</p>
<p>The
Display section will draw the RT curves for the selected formula(s) on the RT
graph. Note that before you will be able to see the Schroeder curve, you must
first press the Schroeder button in the <i>Replace By</i> section to tell the
program to calculate Schroeder RT fig-ures.</p>
<p>Let’s
display the Schroeder RT Times , as well as those calculated by Eyring and
Sabine formulas. Check all three.</p>
<p>As you
can see from the curves show on the next page, there are noticeable differences
between the projections.</p>
<p>In general,
the RT times projected by Schroeder are considered to be more accurate.
Remember, both Sabine and Eyring are generalized formulas. Schroeder is based
on the declining energy levels projected by the program.</p>
<p>The RT
times projected by Schroeder also will vary from Listeners Seat to Listeners
Seat, while the generalized Eyring and Sabine formu-las produce only one RT
time for the room. Another thing to remember while looking at the graph is that
the scaling accentuates the differ-ences.</p>

<p>Note
that <i>Add Estimated Exponential Tail Energy</i> and <i>Include Pulses Outside

Tail Energy </i>tells EASE to add and use a calculated tail in its RT
calculations.<i> Include Pulses Outside Start/Stop Times </i>tells the<i> </i>program
to use all the pulses in the Reflectogram even if some are outside the Start
and Stop times entered for the Regression Interval.</p>
<p><i>Add
Energy Due to Impact Chance </i>is mainly used with short
reflectograms to get realistic Reverberation Tails in the calculations. You'll<i>

<p>Note
that selecting <i>Draw Schroeder Curve into Reflectogram</i> will add the
Schroeder curve to the Reflectogram. See below.</p>

<p>EASE
also allows you to compare the rooms projected RT times to the times normally
considered ideal for various types of usage. To ex-plore this option, go to the
<i>Reverberation</i> section of the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu and select <i>Tolerance</i>.
This will add a Tolerance window to the graph.</p>
<p>Then
open the <i>Options</i> folder (<i>F9</i> or right click on the graph and
select <i>Options</i>) and click on the <i>Tolerance</i> tab to open the
Tolerance folder shown below.</p>
<p><img

<p>As you
can see, you have a choice of 3 Tolerance Norms. The Standard Norm is based on
European thinking and allows the rooms in-tended use to be taken in
consideration. Dolby, as the name implies was influenced by US theater
thinking, while THX is the standard used by Lucas Film for cinemas.</p>
<p>When
Standard is selected as the Norm, The Room Purpose buttons produce a new
tolerance window for the common usages shown. If you explore the variations you
will find the 1 kHz RT times vary from a low of 1.2 for Lecture/Sport
facilities to 2.2 for Organ Music.</p>

<p>If you
explore the variations, you will notice that the RT times of the Theater 1 room
we have been using as a model are too low for good music reproduction. If you
skipped the Optimize RT section of the manual, now would be a good time to
review it and find out how EASE can help you determine what surface material
changes would increase the RT time.</p>
<p>Also
note that the RT times developed in the Probe module are used only in Probe
calculations. If you want to use the Schroeder figures in EASE Mapping, you
will need to manually copy them into <i>Edit Room/Room Data/Room RT</i> and
then check <i>RT Locked</i>.</p>
<p>Before
we move on to the next step, we should consider saving the Response file
(Reflectogram) we generated from the Impact File. Oth-erwise, it will be lost
when we exit this mode and will have to be recreated the next time we want to
look at it. Selecting <i>Save Response</i> <i>File As </i>under the<i> File </i>pull
down menu and following the prompts will take care of this. Now, exit from the
Find Impacts/Probe program.</p>
<p><b>Mirror
Image Impacts</b></p>
<p>Mirror
Image Impacts is another way to produce Impact Files. It uses rays like Ray
Tracing, but uses an algorithm to determine which rays will impact on the
target and then traces only those rays. It seeks out 100 % of the impacts and
leaves nothing to chance. But, the calcula-tions also take longer, especially
in rooms having a large number of Faces. Mirror Image Impacts is not
recommended for use in rooms having more than 40 Faces or in 10th order or
higher reflections studies.</p>
<p>Impact
Files generated by Mirror Image Impacts have the same characteristics as those
generated by Ray Tracing Impacts and are treated the same by the View Impacts
program. Selecting <i>Mirror Image Impacts</i> from the <i>Ray Tracing</i> pull
down menu opens the control screen shown below.</p>

<p>If the
same setup criteria is used as the criteria we used before in Find Impacts,
namely a Reflection Order of 10 and a 375 ms Time frame, the calculation will
take many hours. Ray Tracing Impacts completed the calculations in less than 3
hours when 200,000 Rays were used.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
<p>A
general rule for producing good reflectograms in a reasonable period of time is
that the Mean Free Path Time of the room times the Re-flection Order should
approximately equal the Time Frame. The Mean Free Time can be found in the Room
Data folder under the Edit pull down menu in Edit Project. It is .03 sec or 30
ms for Theater 1. A Reflection Order of 12 times 30 gives us 360 ms for the
Time Frame.</p>
<p>With
these parameters, 100,000 Rays per loudspeaker produces an 80.5 % probability
factor. Refer to Chapter 11 on AURA and Chapter 12 on Auralization for more
information on creating good reflectograms.</p>
<p><b>Split
Impact File</b></p>
<p>If we
had elected to use only one Listeners Seat when we created our Impact File
using Find Impacts w would have had to run another simulation to look at other
Listener Seat locations. We avoided this by using all 5 seats in our original
Find Impacts study.</p>
<p>Many
experienced users will use multiple Listener Seats in their simulations and set
up any lengthy calculations at the end of the day so their computer work on
them overnight. The disadvantage of this is the large files they produce. Our 5
Listener Seat Impact File, for ex-ample, is over 100 MB.</p>
<p>Split
Impact File provides a means of easily breaking large, multiple Listeners Seat
files into individual files. Activation of <i>Split Impact Files</i> brings up
a prompt asking for the name of the file you want to split. Entering the file
name and clicking on <i>OK</i> will split the file into as many files as there
were Listeners Seats in the original file. The Files will identified with their
Listener Seat name, for example by -1,-2, etc..</p>
<p><b>Update
Impact File</b></p>
<p>Update
Trace File allows you to change wall materials or loudspeaker models in a model
and then quickly &quot;update&quot; (recalculate) associ-ated .trc Trace Files
and .mpc Impact Files. Changes that can be accommodated also include
loudspeaker aiming, delay and alignment. Geometric changes, such as relocating
a Loudspeaker or rearranging Faces cannot be handled by this feature.</p>
<p>Operation
is simple, open the <i>Update Trace File</i> window, enter the name of the file
you want to update and then hit the <i>OK</i> button.</p>
<p>One
word of caution about this feature. The Update Trace File routine upgrades the
existing File; it does not create a new one. Thus, you will lose access to the
existing file unless you first save it as a Response File or make a copy of it
under another name.</p>
