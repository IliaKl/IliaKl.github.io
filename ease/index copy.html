<p><b>Installation and Registration Instructions</b></p>
<p>Before you begin to install EASE 4.3 on your computer, make sure
your computer has sufficient memory and hard disk space.</p>
<p>EASE runs under Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems on
PC's with a VGA graphics system. Windows 95, Windows ME (Millennium), Windows
2000 and Windows NT are not supported. Multi core processors and 64-bit
resolution are supported.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements are a machine with 256 MB or more of RAM,
600 MHz or higher clock speed and at least 2 gigabyte or more of hard disk
space (EASE requires a minimum of 600 MB of hard disk space.) Faster, 800 MHz
or higher clock speeds and larger RAMs are highly recommended for advanced
users. Microsoft .NET Framework v2.0 is also required. Refer to Addendum 1 for
more detailed equip-ment requirements.</p>
<p>Note 1. If you are using a virus protection system, you should
disable it before beginning the installation.</p>
<p>Note 2. If you have EASE 3.0 installed on your machine, you do
not need to uninstall it before installing EASE 4.3. The two programs are
compatible and can run side by side on the same machine. You will be asked by
the 4.3 install program if you want to uninstall EASE 3.0. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>Note 3. If you have EASE 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 installed on your
machine, you do not need to uninstall them before installing 4.3. The 4.3 In-</p>
<p><img width=377 height=91
src="E1.files/image005.jpg"></p>
<p>stall routine will automatically ask if you want to uninstall
the previous version. Answer <i>Yes</i> to both uninstall prompts. You may also
en-counter <i>Shared File Detected</i> and <i>Read Only File Detected</i>
dialog boxes. In both case select <i>Don’t display this message again</i> and
then click on Yes.</p>
<p><b>Important: The default file path structure for earlier versions
of EASE and EASE JR placed the Data and Project files in an EASE40Data
directory on your C: drive. The current MS recommended path structure places
the Data and Project files in C:\Documents and Settings\All
Users\Documents\EASE40Data in systems running under XP and in
C:\Users\Public\Documents\EASE40Data on machines using Vista.</b></p>
<p><b>If you are installing 4.3 on a computer that has not had EASE
installed on it previously, the install program will automatically use the MS
recommended path structure. If you are updating a previous EASE installation to
4.3, the install program will give you the opportunity to <i>“Reset all
installation adjustments to default values”</i>, meaning set them to the MS
recommended file structure. VISTA users must select this option; it is optional
for XP users, but for consistency and standardization we recommend selecting
this option and using the new MS recommended file structure.</b></p>
<p><b>Note: If you are updating an existing EASE installation under
VISTA or will be using the MS recommended file structure under XP, you must
first “Upload “ your License Key. Otherwise, you will lose your License Key
during the update. Open EASE and go to <i>Help\Registe</i>r and press the <i>Upload</i>
button to upload your license key.</b></p>
<p><b>If you are updating an existing installation to the MS file
structure, be aware that doing a Complete install will probably cre-ate a
second set of data files unless you move your old data files before installing
the new ones.</b></p>
<p>The install program will not detect the existing EASE40Data
folder on your C: drive and will create a new one. To prevent this from
happening, XP users should first move their EASE40Data folder to C:\ Documents
and Settings\All Users\ Shared Documents\ and Vista users to <i>C:\Users\Public\Documents\.</i>
The install program will then detect the old data and give you
the option of leaving it un-touched or of overwriting/updating it.</p>
<p>Doing a Program Only install will not produce a second set of data
files, but after the installation is completed you will probably want to move
your old data/project files to the new directory locations or change the path
setups in EASE to point to the old file locations.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>If you are installing 4.3 from CD’s:</b></p>
<p>Insert the EASE 4.3 Program CD into your CD drive. The Install
program should open automatically. If it doesn’t, from the Start menu select <i>Settings</i>,
then <i>Control Panel</i> and <i>Add/Remove Programs</i>. Click on <i>Install</i>
and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>Note: If for some reason Windows can not locate the EASE setup
program, click on the <i>Browse</i> button to manually locate the Setup program
on the EASE 4.3 CD. Double-click on the <i>Setup.exe</i> file to launch the
Setup program.</p>
<p>Then, insert the EASE 4.3 EASE Guard License Control CD and
install the license control program. You will not be able to register your
program and obtain a license key until the license control program is installed.</p>
<p><b>If you are downloading and installing 4.3 from the web:</b></p>
<p>Go to the AFMG Download Portal, <b><a
href="http://www.afmg-support.eu/afmgdlportal/start.aspx">http://www.afmg-support.eu/afmgdlportal/start.aspx</a></b> and
enter your e-mail address and password. If you forgot your password, put in
your e-mail address and click on <i>Submi</i>t. If a password was previously
issued to the e-mail address you entered, it will be sent to you automatically
by e-mail. If the e-mail address does not match an existing password, AFMG will
get in touch with you.</p>
<p>If this is your first visit to the download portal and you
haven’t established an account and obtained a password, you will have to
register to obtain one. Click on <i>Don’t have an account? Create One</i> and
complete the registration form. Fill in the fields as best as you can. The
program won’t accept your request until you have filled out all the fields.</p>

<p>If</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>up-</p>
<p>dating an existing program and don’t know your User’s ID number,
open Win-dows Explorer and browse to <i>C:\Program Files\EASE 4.0\
EasePath\User ID</i>. Your User ID is stored there. Note that on your computer,
the EASE file may be identified EASE 4.1,EASE 4.2 or EASE 4.3 instead of EASE
4.0.</p>
<p><img width=276 height=318
src="E1.files/image007.jpg"></p>
<p>When you have your password enter it into the Password field and
press <i>Log</i> <i>In </i>to open the download window.</p>
<p>When the Download window opens, select <i>Program Setups</i> and
download ei-ther the <i>Program Only Setup</i> or the <i>Complete CD Setup</i>.
The Complete CD Setup includes the associated Data Files (Speaker &amp;
Material data files, etc.) which you will need if you are installing EASE for
the first time on your ma-chine. The Program Only Setup does not include the
data files. When the Save As dialog box appears note where the file will be
saved on your computer.</p>
<p>If EASE Guard is not already installed on your machine from a
previous 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 installation, also select <i>Licence Guard Setups</i>
and download the EASE Guard setup archive belonging to your EASE User ID.</p>

<p>Make sure that you have Microsoft .NET 2.0 Framework installed
on your machine. Ease 4.3 needs it to operate. If you don’t have it, click on
Net Framework to connect to the MS download site and download it.</p>
<p>The EASE GLL Viewer is a separate program that allows users to
view GLL loudspeaker data created in AFMG’s SpeakerLab program and stored in
the GLL data format. Both are new no-charge additions to EASE and becoming
increasingly popular as more manufacturers de-velop loudspeaker data in the GLL
format.</p>
<p>The GLL (Generic Loudspeaker Library) is a comprehensive,
descriptive, object oriented loudspeaker data format designed to store and
exchange complex data on loudspeaker systems and other acoustic sources. If you
are not familiar with the GLL concept, refer to the GLL/SpeakerLab section of
this manual.</p>
<p>We suggest you download and install both the GLL Viewer and
SpeakerLab and become familiar with them. One word of caution; if you decide to
Install SpeakerLab, be sure to also download the <i>SpeakerLab User Files
Setups</i>. EASE and SpeakerLab are separate programs and have separate license
keys. You will need the SpeakerLab User Files to obtain a license key for
SpeakerLab.</p>
<p>When the downloads are completed, extract (unzip) the <i>EASE4.3.zip</i>
file. You may also want to burn the contents of the EASE CD setup folder onto a
CD for backup purposes. If you will be installing 4.3 on several machines, it’s
a lot easier to do it from a CD than it is to re-peatedly download it.</p>
<p><b>Remember: If you are updating an existing EASE installation, you
need to first “Upload “ your License Key. Otherwise, you will lose your license
key during the update. Open EASE and go to <i>Help\Register</i> and press the <i>Upload</i>
button.</b></p>
<p>If you are updating an existing installation to the MS file
structure, be aware that doing a Complete install will probably create a second
set of data files unless you move your old data files before installing the new
ones.</p>
<p>The install program will not detect the existing EASE40Data
folder on your C: drive and will create a new one. To prevent this from
happen-ing, XP users should first move their EASE40Data folder to C:\ Documents
and Settings\All Users\Shared Documents\ and Vista users to <i>C:\Users\Public\Documents\.
</i>The install program will then detect the old data and give you the option
of leaving it untouched or of overwrit-ing/updating it.</p>
<p>Doing a Program Only install will not produce a second set of
data files, but after the installation is completed you will probably want to
move your old data/project files to the new directory locations or change the
path setups in EASE to point to the old file locations.</p>
<p>When you ready to begin the installation, double click on <i>Setup.exe</i>
in the EASE 4.3 folder to start the installation.</p>
<p>During the installation you may encounter <i>Shared File
Detected</i> and <i>Read Only File Detected</i> dialog boxes. In both cases
select <i>Don’t dis-play this message again </i>and then click on<i> Yes.</i></p>
<p><img width=320 height=248
src="E1.files/image008.jpg"></p>
<p>After accepting the License Agreement, an EASE 4.3 Setup window
will open; select the <i>Complete</i> install unless you have reason to install
only the program or just the data files.</p>
<p>The EASE program will install first.</p>

<p>If you are updating an existing installation, a Remove or Repair
dia-log box will open next. Select <i>Remove</i>.</p>
<p><img width=441 height=643
src="E1.files/image009.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Reset all installation adjustments to default values</i>
box needs to be checked by all VISTA users who are updating an earlier 4.xx
in-stallation. We also recommend that XP users do the same.</p>
<p>Installation of the data files will begin as soon as the EASE
program files have been installed . All you need to do is to follow the prompts
and select the data you want to install.</p>
<p>We recommend installing the Examples and either the English or
German Material Database. You definitely need one of the Material databases.</p>
<p>Note that before the Speaker Data installa-tion begins, you are
given the option of pre-selecting all the Speaker Data files for installation
or of proceeding to the next screen and individually selecting the file you
want.</p>
<p>The complete Speaker Database includes over 80 manufacturer’s
products and occu-pies over 600 MB of disk space, so you may want to pick and
choose what manu-facturers you want to include in your data-base. You can
always add one of the manufacturer’s databases at a later time.</p>
<p>After the EASE installation is completed, the installer will
proceed to install SpeakerLab and the GLL Viewer. Just follow the prompts to
in-stall them.</p>
<p>When the program installation is complete, in-stall the EASE
Guard license control program from the EASE 4.3 EASE Guard License Con-trol CD
or by executing the EASE Guard setup file you downloaded from the web.</p>
<p><img width=319 height=228

<p><b>Note that:</b></p>
<p><b>1. Before you can use EASE, you will have to install the
EASE Guard License Control program and download a license key.</b></p>
<p><b>2. Before you can use SpeakerLab, you will have to install
the</b></p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Registration Instructions</b></p>
<p>Your EASE JR / EASE License allows you to install and run the
program simultaneously on 2 machines. Use of the program is controlled by
License Keys (sometimes referred to as User Keys) issued by AFMG with each EASE
License entitling you to 2 License Keys.</p>
<p>If you want to use the program on more than 2 machines, you must
purchase additional License Keys. Additional License Keys are avail-able in
sets of two and allow you to use the program on 2 additional machines.</p>
<p>License Keys are managed and controlled by the EASE Guard
License Control program.</p>
<p>Note that SpeakerLab is a separate program and has its own
License Manager program and license keys. Please refer to Chapter 14 for
details.</p>
<p>Key elements of the EASE Guard license control program are the:</p>
<p><b>USER ID Number</b></p>
<p>The USER ID number is the identification number assigned to your
company at the time you purchased the License. It includes details on any
previous EASE licenses you owned and identifies what version of EASE you
purchased; for example EASE or EASE JR. You cannot obtain License Keys without
it.</p>
<p>If you received delivery of your program over the web, your User
ID number was included in the e-mail letter of download instructions you
received from AFMG. If you purchased backup CD’s, you will find your USER ID
number on the rear of the EASE and EASE Guard CD jewel cases.</p>
<p><b>Reference File</b></p>
<p>The Reference File (sometimes called Reference Key) is a file
(an .erf Ease Reference File) generated by the EASE Guard license control
program. It identifies your computer and its operating system and is linked to
your License Key. This file is different for each computer.</p>
<p>Any change in your computer’s operating system will be detected
by EASE Guard and the link between your computer and the Li-cense Key will be
broken and you will no longer be able to use the program. You will have lost
your License Key and will not be able to run EASE until you have obtained a
replacement from AFMG.</p>
<p><b>License File</b></p>
<p>The License File (usually called a License Key or a Users key,
and sometimes referred to as a a Seat) is a file (an .elf Ease License File)
generated by ADA. It is linked to your USER ID Number and to your computer’s
Reference File and unlocks the specific EASE version you purchased.</p>
<p><b>Obtaining a License Key</b></p>
<p>1. As soon as the EASE Guard installation is completed,
start EASE by double clicking on the EASE Icon.</p>
<p>2. Then double click on the Register Icon in the EASE
4.3 desktop window or open the Help pull down menu and select <i>Register</i>.
This will open the EASE Registra-tion prompt shown below.</p>

<p>3. Answering <i>Yes</i> will bring up the dialog box shown
below.</p>
<p><img width=343 height=95
src="E1.files/image012.jpg"></p>
<p>An affirmative answer will close EASE, launch the EASE Guard
program and open the window shown below.</p>
<p><img width=454 height=252
src="E1.files/image013.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that it tells you a valid license has not been installed
on your computer.</p>
<p>Clicking on the big Download License button will connect you to
the EASE license key download site on the ADA server, send your com-puter’s
reference information to the site and, if everything checks out, generate your
License Key and install it on your computer. The entire operation is automated
and takes only a few seconds.</p>
<p>Notice that after the License Key has been installed, the
License Status fields will now show what version of EASE is installed, your
com-pany name and the number of license keys installed on your computer. It
will show 1, since you downloaded only one License Key.</p>
<p><img width=454 height=252
src="E1.files/image014.jpg"></p>
<p>If you now press the <i>Info</i> button, it will tell you how
many License Keys are still available for download. Do not download them onto
your computer unless you have a specific need for them. They are safer on ADA’s
site than they would be stored on your computer.</p>

<p>If you have a second computer with Web access, you can download
a License Key to it by following the same procedure you used with the first
computer. Other users within your company can also obtain License Keys for
their computers, if additional License Keys are available.</p>
<p>The license key download feature usually works flawlessly. If it
doesn’t, an error message will let you know there is a problem.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=108
src="E1.files/image015.jpg"></p>
<p>One common reason for the download procedure not working
properly is that your Firewall/Virus protection system is blocking the
download. Try turning it Off.</p>
<p><img width=192 height=255
src="E1.files/image016.jpg"></p>
<p>If you do not have automatic access to the Web and must “log on”
to gain access, be sure to “log on” to the Web before starting the Online
Licensing procedure. It could be that the download procedure is “timing out”
before the connection is established.</p>
<p>Your browser’s HTTP1.1 setting can also be the source of the
problem.Open your browser’s property’s folder and checking its setting. It
should be set to “<i>Use HTTP1.1</i>” if you do not have a proxy server between
your computer and the web. Otherwise, set it to <i>“User</i> <i>HTTP1.1 through
proxy connections”.</i></p>
<p>If none of these suggestions solve the problem, open the <i>Register</i>
window and click on <i>Licensing by File. </i>See below. Note that the right
portion of the window changes and intro-duces new buttons and tabs.</p>

if you want to automatically send this file to ADA.</p>
<p>If you are using Outlook as your e-mail server, answering <i>Yes</i>
will open an e-mail template ad-dressed to ADA with the .erf attached. In the
body of the e-mail, ask for a License Key and <i>send </i>the e-mail to them.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours (weekends excluded) you will receive an e-mail

<p><b>Exporting License Keys</b></p>
<p>From time to time you may want to Export (move) a License Key
from your computer to another computer.</p>
<p>To Export a License Key, in the Register/Licensing by File window
click on the Import/Export tab to open the window shown below.</p>
<p><img width=487 height=272
src="E1.files/image020.jpg"></p>
<p>Exporting a License Key from your computer (we’ll call it the
Source computer) to another Computer (referred to as the Target computer in the
program) is a multi-step procedure:</p>
<p>1. First, you must load EASE and EASE Guard on the Target
computer and obtain its Reference File. Open EASE on the Target computer and go
to <i>Register/Licensing by File</i> and <i>Import/Expor</i>t to open the
window shown above; click on the <i>Create Reference File</i> button. This will
generate the Target computer’s .ERF Reference File; follow the prompts to save
it to a logical location. Then transfer (move) it to your computer.</p>
<p>2. Open EASE Guard in your computer (the Source computer)
and go to the Import/Export window and click on the big <i>Export License</i>
but-ton. This will open an Open File dialog window; browse to the .ERF
Reference File you just created, select it and click on <i>Open</i>. This will
link the Reference File to your computer’s License Key and generate a .ELF Ease
License File. Follow the prompts to save it to a logical location and then
transfer (move) it to the Target computer.</p>
<p><img width=389 height=289
src="E1.files/image021.jpg"></p>
<p>3. Return to the Import/Export window on the Target computer
and press the <i>Import License</i> button to open an Open File dialog box.
Browse to the .ELF File, select it and then click on <i>Open</i> to install the
License Key on the Target computer.</p>

<p><b>Terminating (Removing) License Keys</b></p>
<p>There are two ways to remove a license key from your computer to
prevent its being lost while you upgrade your operating system or when you are
replacing it with a new computer. This protects you from losing your License
Key in the transition. Remember, any change in your computer’s operating system
will be detected by EASE Guard and the link between your computer and the
License Key will be broken.</p>
<p>The recommended way, and the simplest way, is to Upload your
License Key to the ADA site and then Download it after your system is up-graded
or Download it onto your new computer. To do this, open EASE and go to <i>Register</i>
under the <i>Help</i> pull down menu and click on the <i>Upload </i>button.</p>
<p>If you have problems uploading the License Key, you can also
officially terminate it. To terminate your computer’s License Key, select the <i>Terminate
</i>folder under the<i> Register/Licensing By File </i>window. Then press the<i>
Terminate Licence </i>button.</p>
<p><img width=410 height=228
src="E1.files/image022.jpg"></p>
<p>This will open a Save File window. Enter a logical location for
the file and then click on <i>Save</i>. A Send E-mail Now prompt will appear.
If you are running Outlook, clicking on <i>Yes</i> will send the Termination
file to ADA. If you don’t have direct access to the web or the e-mail template doesn’t
open, Save the file and then use a computer that has E-mail capabilities to
E-mail it to licence@ada-acousticdesign.de. Be sure to tell ADA why you
have sent the Termination file to them and ask them to place a replacement key
in your file.</p>
<p><b>Remove License</b></p>
<p>The Remove License button in the Terminate window is used only
to correct licensing problems resulting from software or hardware errors. Don’t
use it unless you are having problems and you are told to use it by ADA or the
Renkus-Heinz support staff. Don’t use it without our knowledge and consent, as
it will remove all licensing information from your computer and complicate the
task of recovering a lost License Key.</p>
<p><b>Protect Licence</b></p>
<p>For those who want to maintain tight control over their EASE
License Keys, EASE 4.3 includes a Protect Licence feature. It is accessible
under the Help pull down menu.</p>
<p>Protect Licence, when activated, removes the EASE Guard License
Control program from the computer without removing the License Key. This makes
it impossible for the user to access the EASE website to upload or download
additional License Keys or to export the key to another computer.</p>
<p><b>Program Updates</b></p>
<p>The development staff at ADA is constantly updating the EASE
program. The latest updates are stored on the ADA site and can easily be
downloaded by any licensed EASE user having access to the web. Open the <i>Help</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Ease Update</i> to connect to the ADA download
portal.</p>

<p>The latest updates to the loudspeaker and wall material
databases are also available to you. Selecting <i>DataBase Update</i> from the <i>Help</i>
pull down menu will open the Update Manager. The down arrow allows you to
select either the Speaker or the Material database for review.</p>
<p><img width=360 height=778

<p><b>Recovering Lost License Keys</b></p>
<p>At some point in time through no fault oy your own you may lose
a License Key. Your hard drive will crash and burn, someone unfamiliar with
EASE will decide to reformat your computer without your knowledge or some other
unforeseen event will occur.</p>
<p>When this happens, it is important that you get in touch with
ADA and ask for a replacement as soon as possible. Don’t wait until you have an
urgent need to use the program</p>
<p>Recovering a lost EASE or EASE JR license key is a relatively
simple process , but it usually takes at least 24 hours as each request is
personally reviewed.</p>
<p>Open EASE/EASE JR on any machine that has both EASE and EASE
Guard installed.</p>
<p>Select <i>Create Status Report</i> from the Help pull down menu.</p>
<p><img width=320 height=231
src="E1.files/image024.jpg"></p>
<p>Create Status Report will gather all the computers licensing
files into a single EASE40Info.Zip file that you can send to ADA along with a
request for a replacement license key.</p>
<p>Note: If the EASE program won’t open, go to <i>Start/All
Programs/EASE/Tools</i> and click on <i>Create Status Report</i> to activate
it.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Create Status Report</i> will open the familiar
Window’s “Save” screen giving you the opportunity to save the file under
another name and/or to choose a different file location.. We suggest you accept
the default name and location. Clicking on Save will open the dia-log screen
shown below.</p>
<p><img width=248 height=110
src="E1.files/image025.jpg"></p>
<p>If you are using Outlook as your e-mail client, clicking on <i>Yes</i>
will open an e-mail template addressed to ADA with the .info file attached.</p>
<p>If you are not using Outlook you may have to create a new e-mail
to ADA and attach the .info file to it. The automatic send routine does not
work on all e-mail clients.</p>
<p>The e-mail should be sent to <i>licence@ada-acousticdesign.de</i>.
Be sure to explain in the body of the e-mail what has happened and ask for a
replacement license key. Otherwise, ADA won’t know why you sent the info file
to them. You should hear from them within a working day.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to provide you a working knowledge
of the program and its many features and capabilities. This section is intended
to help you become acquainted with the program. The tutorial sections that
follow will lead you through most of the important EASE features, including
room modeling and the acoustic simulation processes.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: Please don't skip any part of the tutorial. The time you
spend working on the various exercises in the tutorial will save you hours and
hours of time later on. Even after you complete the tutorial you will find it
helpful to refer back to it from time-to-time. It contains a wealth of helpful
hints and shortcuts. If you don't have time now to do all the tutorial
exercises, at least scan through the tutorial to become acquainted with all the
features of EASE. Then, use the manual as a reference guide when you need
guidance in how to accomplish specific tasks.</b></p>
<p>*If you are using EASE JR, substitute EASE JR for EASE as you
read this tutorial</p>
<p><b>General Information</b></p>
<p>EASE is actually a number of separate,individual programs or
program modules, some of which are stand alone programs linked together. The
EASE Main program is the Parent program from which all the other programs
(child programs) emanate. During use only the pro-gram(s) needed to perform the
required task(s) need to be running. As a general rule, the various programs
open automatically when they are needed to perform a task, but must be manually
closed.</p>
<p>Stand Alone modules can be run separately without the need to
run the main program; for example, the Speaker Base program can be run to
create or analyze a cluster not associated with a specific opened project.</p>
<p>This technique provides a great deal of flexibility, but it also
requires that data be exchanged between the various program modules. Op-tion
settings give you control over how the exchange takes place (automatically or
manually). The usual setting has the data exchange taking place automatically
when the modules are opened or closed (accompanied by a Prompt if you desire
one). However, even when the option settings call for automatic exchange, there
are times the exchange may have to be initiated manually. You'll encounter
examples of this as you work your way through the tutorial.</p>
<p>A list of all the program modules and block diagram showing the
primary program module structure can be found in the Appendix at the end of
this manual. You may want to take a few minutes to study the block diagram as
an understanding of the relationship between mod-ules is helpful in
understanding the program.</p>
<p><b>Key Commands</b></p>
<p>With EASE you will be using both key commands and a mouse,
especially while modeling a room. Key commands are helpful as they speed up
many of the processes and you should make a point of learning them as you work
with the program. This is especially true if you will be using the program
regularly. You’ll be surprised how much faster modeling goes once you start
using the key commands.</p>
<p>A few of the key commands you will want to memorize follow.
Notice that the key commands vary from module to module.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 Manual</b></p>
<p>The EASE 4.3 Manual is essentially a PDF version of the EASE
Help files. It was loaded onto your computer along with the program and stored
in the EASE 4.3 Manual folder under EASE 4.3/Easepath in your computers Program
Files directory.</p>
<p>Take a look at it. You may want to print it and use it as a
handy refer-ence manual. It contains a wealth of idetailed information on the
pro-gram, including an Appendix that describes and details the Acoustic
Formulae used in EASE and a detailed list of all the key commands.</p>

<p><b>Starting EASE</b></p>
<p>From the Windows Start menu, choose <i>All Programs</i> and then
select EASE or double click on the EASE 4.3 icon placed on your desktop by the
installation program.</p>
<p>Note that if this is the first time you have opened EASE, a
screen prompt will ask for your name. Add it and then click <i>OK</i>. Then the
Main Menu screen shown below will open.</p>
<p><img width=670 height=484
src="E1.files/image029.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE 4.3 offers you three different ways to take the next step.
You can open the <i>File</i> pull down menu, use the Tool Bar Icons at the top
of the window or use the Desktop Icons to make your selection,. The choice is
yours, use the method that works best for you.</p>
<p>Notice that placing the cursor over any one of the Tool Bar
icons or Desktop icons brings up a description of that icon’s function. This is
a standard feature of the user friendly GUI of EASE 4.3.</p>
<p>You may also have noticed that the Edit and View pull down menus
in the Menu Bar are not active. They will be activated as soon as a project is
selected and read into RAM..</p>

<p>One of the features of EASE 4.3 is the ability to build your own
Desktop with shortcuts to the functions you most often use. To see how this
works, double-click on the Start Working icon, then double-click on the Desktop
icon. This will open the screen shown below.</p>
<p><img width=511 height=371
src="E1.files/image030.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the yellow Desktop section is blank. You can easily
add shortcuts to the Desktop by selecting them with the right Mouse button and
then left clicking on the <i>Add Link to Desktop</i> prompt that appears.
Desktop shortcuts can just as easily be removed by right clicking on them and
then left clicking on the <i>Remove Link to Desktop</i> prompt.</p>
<p>You’ll find the ability to build your own Desktop a useful
feature after you have become familiar with the program ant the functions you
use again and again.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move on and set up the basic operating parameters for
EASE. We’ll use the <i>File</i> pull down menu. Selecting the File pull down
menu opens the menu shown to the right.</p>
<p><img width=340 height=298
src="E1.files/image031.jpg"></p>
<p>This menu or the Desk Top Icons will probably be the starting
point for most of your EASE sessions since it provides access to your various
Project files, to the Import/Export module, to the Main Databases and to the
Options folder.</p>
<p>The File menu also includes a Pack Project command. This
com-mand is used to gather all the individual files associated with a
particular project into a single file that can be easily Zipped and copied onto
a disk for storage or backup, or e-mailed around the world. We’ll work with
Pack Projects later.</p>
<p>Note that it also provides shortcuts to projects you have
recently viewed or worked with. These shortcuts appear as #1 to #8 in the
graphic shown here. Double clicking on one of the shortcuts will open the
associated project.</p>
<p>Your screen will not list any projects unless you opened one or
two projects before starting the Tutorial.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Options</i> command provides access to the program's
primary set up menus. Clicking on <i>Options</i> will open a typical Windows
Option folder. Let’s take a look at several of the tabs (folders).</p>
<p><img width=291 height=250
src="E1.files/image032.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Data</i> tab folder controls the manner in which data is
exchanged (up-loaded and downloaded) between the program modules. Refer back to
page 2x for details. Note that placing the cursor over one of the Options
produces a brief explanation of the Options function. We suggest you ac-cept
the default “Auto” settings.</p>
<p>Note that EASE will warn you if you attempt to run a simulation
without hav-ing properly exchanged data between modules. For example, if after
open-ing one of the Mapping or other post processing modules you make a change
in the model under Edit Project, EASE will warn you a change has been made
before it permits you to run a new simulation. The warning takes the form of a
yellow frame around the simulation screen if the changed proj-ect data was
checked, but not acquired by the simulation module. If the data wasn’t checked,
the frame is red. The Acquire Data icon in the Tool Bar section, Ctrl O or the
File menu option Acquire Project Data will download the new data if it is
Checked.</p>
<p><img width=291 height=250
src="E1.files/image033.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE automatically creates a Temporary Project file whenever you
open the Edit Project program module. When Auto-Apply is checked, the
Tempo-rary Projects file is updated whenever you Check Data. One of its
purposes is to protect you against losing a lot of work, if you inadvertently
close the Edit Project program without having saved your work.</p>
<p>The <i>Delete Temporary Projects</i> section of the Data window
allows you to control whether this file is automatically deleted whenever you
exit the pro-gram or is automatically saved, or whether you are given the
opportunity to decide on an individual basis. This feature does not protect
against com-puter crashes, unless you have saved (applied) your work as you
pro-ceeded. Your best protection against crashes is to routinely and regularly
Apply and Save your changes by using the <i>Ctrl + F6</i> key command.</p>
<p><img width=291 height=250
src="E1.files/image034.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Setting</i> tab allows you to select Metric (m) or
English (Ft.) as the De-fault measurement system. The default setting is
Metric, so change it to English (Ft.) if most of your work will be done in
feet. You also have the op-portunity to change the way the program looks (Play
Animated Messages) and sounds (Play EASE Sounds). We recommend the default
settings, but you may want to try out the Animated Messages.</p>
<p>The <i>Default Paths</i> tab shows you the various default paths
the program has established and gives you the opportunity to change them. We
strongly suggest leaving them as they are unless you have a good reason to
change them. The Default Paths shown reflect the Microsoft recommended path
structure used in Vista installations. If you are an XP user, the path
structure will probably be <i>C:\Ease40Data\.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Video Adapter</i> tab provides a means of quickly
checking your Video Drivers ability to handle Open GL renderings. The <i>Run
Check</i> but-ton will look for your system’s Video Driver and then display its
parameters in the left field. <i>Load Database</i> produces a listing of Video
Driv-ers whose Open GL performance has been checked by ADA. The Font tab give
you the opportunity to change the type of Font used by the program and its
size.</p>
<p>The User tab provides a location for you to register your name
and enter (store) your User ID number. <b>All users should enter their name</b>
<b>and User ID number before proceeding.</b></p>

<p><b>A Brief Tour</b></p>
<p>Before we begin to model a new room, lets take a short walk
through the program. Warning, if before starting the Tutorial you explored the
program and changed some of the settings, you may not see the exact screens
shown in the Tutorial. If you experience graphic problems or Open GL warnings
during the tour, the chances are you have a video driver problem.</p>
<p><b>Opening a Project</b></p>
<p>EASE offers you three ways to open a Project; <i>Open Project</i>
under the <i>File</i> pull down menu, the <i>Open Project</i> icon (the file
folder icon) in the Tool Bar or the <i>Start Working</i> icon on the Desk Top.</p>
<p>Either method will take you to the Projects40 Folder where you
can select the desired project. We want to review the Theater1_09 project. It
should be stored in the EASE40Data/Projects40/ Theater 1 folder on your C:
Drive. We’ll use the <i>Open Project</i> icon in the Tool Bar to open the
project.</p>
<p>Note: If during installation you elected to store the EASE40
Data on another drive, it will be located there instead of on the C: Drive.
Vista users will find the Projects40 folder under C;\documents and Settings\All
Users\Shared Documents\EASE40 Data.</p>
<p>Click on the icon, then select <i>Theater 1</i> and <i>Theater
1_09.frd</i>. This will bring up (upload) the Theater1_09 files and introduce a
Prompt ad-vising you that the Loading is complete and asking if you want to
“Draw Room”. Answering <i>Yes</i> will open the Edit Project window. For now,</p>
<p>click on .</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Project Data Files</b></p>
<p>The tree in the left panel represents a quick way to review the
data files associated with the project and then, if you want, print a hard copy
for your files. Selecting <i>Loudspeakers</i>, for example, produces in the
right panel a listing of all the loudspeakers used in the project, com-plete
with their locations and their aiming angles.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Send Picture To</i> from the <i>File</i> pull down
menu will give you the choice of sending the window to the Clipboard, to File
in a number of different file formats, or to the EasePage Designer. The
EasePage Designer allows you to customize the graphic by adding notes and then
either save or print the graphic.</p>
<p>Saving the window to the Clipboard allows you to copy the window
into another program such as Word, customize it and then file it away or print
it.</p>
<p>No matter how you save it, you end up with a hard copy list of
the Loudspeakers being used in the project and their location that you can turn
over to your installation crew. It takes all the guesswork out of where to hang
the loudspeakers and how to aim them.</p>
<p><img width=647 height=485
src="E1.files/image036.jpg"></p>
<p>Now it’s time to open the Edit Project Data window where most of
the modeling takes place.</p>
<p>Either select the <i>Edit Project Data</i> icon in the tool bar
or click on <i>Project Data</i> under the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=672 height=495
src="E1.files/image037.jpg"></p>
<p>Note the intersecting red, green and blue lines. They mark the
0, 0, 0 point of the model and the x, y and z axis to help you keep your
ori-entation while viewing the model from different angles. Green is the + y
axis, Red the + x axis and Blue the + z axis.</p>
<p>The blue icons represent loudspeakers.</p>
<p>The purple lines show the loudspeaker aiming points and can be
easily turned off.</p>
<p>The areas outlined in green are the Audience Areas upon which
most of the performance mapping will take place.</p>
<p>The red chairs are Listener Seats that have been placed in the
model for use in detailed electro-acoustic simulations.</p>
<p>As you can see, the top portion of the Edit Project screen is
devoted to the Main menu bar and a number of Tool Bars. The left side of the
screen has two Tool Bars, the ones most often used in constructing a model.
These Tool Bars place within easy reach the most frequently used tools needed
to Edit (construct or change) a model. Don't worry about having to memorize
their use; dragging the cursor over any tool brings up its description. Try it,
it works.</p>
<p>The status bar at the bottom of the screen gives you the
identity and location of any item you have selected (picked) and other useful
sta-tus information.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that many of the Tool Bar commands can
also be initiated with Key commands. If you know the Key commands, it’s usually
easier and faster to use them. Most, if not all of the commands can also be
accessed by using the pull down menus in the Main menu bar. The Tool Bars can
be moved to any spot on the screen by grabbing the Move bar on their left side
and dragging them to a new location. They can also be deleted and then restored
at a later time using the Modify Toolbar command under the File pull down menu.</p>
<p>The scroll bars on the sides and bottom of the screen allow you
to turn, rotate and resize the room drawing. They make it easy to view the room
from any angle, a very important feature. Try out the scroll bars. Its fun, and
you need to become familiar with them.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the model turns or rotates around the center of the
image. You can change this by using the cursor and left mouse button to se-lect
a point on the model. The model will then rotate or turn around that point. It
should be noted that the model itself does not rotate or turn. What is actually
rotated or turned is your point of view of the model. By moving the scroll
bars, you are virtually moving yourself around the model for better viewing.</p>
<p>Another way to turn and rotate the room is the Turn icon in the
Tool Bars. Use the left Mouse button and cursor to turn the drawing and the
right Mouse button to zoom in and out on the drawing.</p>
<p>The F11 and F12 key commands also allow you to Zoom In and Zoom
Out at will. You can also shrink and expand the drawing using the scroll wheel
on your mouse. And, last but not least, the <i>Zoom In</i> icon in the tool bar
section allows you to draw a box around any part of the drawing and zoom in on
it.</p>
<p>When you want to return to the normal isometric view click on
either the <i>3D Perspective</i> icon or the <i>Full</i> icon in the Tool Bars.</p>
<p><b>Terminology</b></p>
<p>To help you understand some of the tools and their use, a brief
description of EASE parameters and terminology follows. The key words are
highlighted in bold type.</p>
<p>In EASE <b>Rooms</b> are constructed from <b>Faces</b> formed by
joining 3 or more <b>Vertices</b> together to define the boundaries (margins)
of the <b>Face</b>. A<b> Face </b>can have from 3 to an unlimited number of<b>
Vertices</b>.</p>
<p><b>Rooms </b>can be<b> Open </b>or<b> Closed</b>. A<b> </b><i>Closed Room</i><b>
</b>is one whose<b> </b><i>Faces</i><b> </b>completely surround (enclose) the<b>
Room</b>. EASE needs a<b> Closed Room </b>before it can calculate the total
surface area and room volume figures needed for many of its simulations.</p>
<p><b>Faces </b>normally have only 1 side of interest to the simulations (the
reflective side) and it must be properly oriented (having the reflective<b> </b>surface
facing into the <b>Room</b>) in order for the <b>Room</b> to be closed, e.g.
have boundary walls. T<b>wo-Fold Faces</b> have two sides that are of interest
to the simulations. They are used to add barriers and reflective/absorptive
panels into the room as well as to paste (<b>Coat</b>) one <b>Fac</b>e on top
of another.</p>
<p><b>Audience Areas </b>are imaginary planes above a
room surface, usually the floor, onto which EASE maps many of its acoustical
simulations.</p>
<p>They are traditionally placed 1.2 m (3.94 feet) above the floor
or at approximately the same height as the ears of seated listeners.</p>
<p>Note: Seating Areas are different than <b>Audience Areas</b>.
They are areas modeled into the room, usually by pasting (<b>Coating</b>) a <b>Two-Fold</b>
<b>Face </b>on top of a floor<b> Face</b>. They make it easy to change the
Room’s acoustical properties to reflect various size audiences by placing<b> </b>materials
having absorption characteristics similar to those of an audience on the
exposed side of the <b>Two-Fold Face</b>.</p>
<p><b>Listener Seats </b>are specific locations (points)
within the<b> Room</b>. They are identified by a chair symbol.</p>
<p><b>Objects </b>are items that have been grouped together
to form a single item (an Object) that can be duplicated, saved or moved as a
single<b> </b>item. <b>Objects</b> can be created from items of different
types; for example from <b>Faces</b>, <b>Loudspeakers</b> and <b>Audience Areas</b>.</p>
<p>When you were practicing with the scroll bars, you may have
noticed that when you picked a spot on one of the Faces, its border changed</p>
<p>from black to either white or yellow. This is the program’s way
of displaying the orientation of that Face. <b>A white outline on a picked Face</b>
<b>means that you are looking at the outside (the non exposed side) of that
Face. Yellow means you are looking at the inside of that Face (the reflective
side), the side that should be facing into the room. Learn this. It’s a crucial
point.</b></p>
<p>Other traditional EASE color assignments are:</p>
<p>The backgroung color is light gray</p>
<p>Vertices are shown in red</p>
<p>Faces are outlined in black until they are selected.</p>
<p>Lamps are yellow.</p>
<p>Other color assignments are possible to suit individual needs or
preferences.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Viewing a Project</b></p>
<p>Now, let's continue our exploration of EASE. Return to the Main
window by clicking on it (you may have to first shrink or mininize the Edit
Project window) and select the <i>View</i> pull down menu and choose <i>Standard
Rendering</i>. Choosing Architectural Rendering would have opened the Vision
program module. We’ll explore Vision in detail in another section of this
manual.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Standard Rendering</i> opens a new program called
Eyes. Note that the Edit Project program remains active. The choice of whether
to leave the Edit Project program open or to close it is yours.</p>
<p><img width=513 height=371
src="E1.files/image038.jpg"></p>
<p>The Eyes program module provides a number of different
eye-catching and illuminating ways of looking at the room. Notice that all of
the walls are solid, except for the ones the program removed to allow you to
look into the room. Note that the isometric view may not be the same isometric
view you were seeing in the Room Editor. If it isn’t, use the 3-D icon in the
Tool Bars to change its orientation. Each click on the icon will turn the view
by 90 degrees around the z-Axis.</p>
<p>Next, go to the <i>Item</i> pull down menu and turn off <i>Outline
all Faces</i>. See below.</p>
<p><img width=499 height=290
src="E1.files/image039.jpg"></p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Some users prefer this view, while others prefer to have all the
Faces outlined as they feel it helps them better visualize the room. Its your
choice. Try selecting Colored Outlines, too. You may like this look even
better. Go to the <i>View</i> pull down menu in the Eyes menu bar and turn off <i>Solid
Rendering</i> by clicking on it to produce another room graphic. Then turn <i>Solid
Rendering</i> back On.</p>
<p>The Audience Areas were probably turned off when you opened
Eyes. Turn them On by going to the <i>Items</i> pull down menu and checking <i>Audience
Areas.</i></p>
<p><img width=499 height=289
src="E1.files/image040.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that under the Items menu, you can also turn “Off” the
Listener Seat and the Loudspeaker symbols.</p>
<p>You also have a choice of showing the Loudspeakers as symbols or
as Case (wireframe) drawings. To make your choice, right click on the screen to
open the Options Folder, select the <i>Items</i> tab and make your choice. It
should be noted that Case drawings for the loudspeakers being used must be
available in EASE before the program can display them. If they aren’t available,
you can create your own Case draw-ings for ones that are missing. We’ll tell
you how later.</p>
<p>The color of the room surfaces (Face colors) was established in
Edit Project Data while the model was being built. Using Face colors is only
one of many ways to color the graphic. Go to the <i>Dye</i> pull down menu to
try out the various ways, especially the <i>Material Alpha</i>, <i>Alpha
Spectrum </i>and<i> Random Color </i>options.</p>
<p>The <i>Material Alpha</i> view allows you to look at the
surfaces based on their absorption characteristics at a specific frequency. The
<i>Alpha</i> <i>Spectrum </i>view paints the surfaces based on their average
absorption over the entire frequency range.<i> Random Color </i>paints each
surface<i> </i>a different color and makes it easy to distinguish one surface
from another.</p>
<p><img width=132 height=262
src="E1.files/image041.jpg"></p>
<p>So far, we have looked at the room from an external point of
view. There are also several ways to look at the room from the inside the
room..</p>
<p>Selecting the <i>Look From Loudspeaker</i> icon in the Tool Bars
(the default position is in the right sec-tion of the top row of Tool Bars)
will open a selection menu giving you the opportunity to choose the Loudspeaker
you want to use to look at the room.</p>
<p>Selecting one (<i>Main</i>, for example) will produce an inside
view of the Room from that loudspeaker’s view point. See next page.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=672 height=328
src="E1.files/image042.jpg"></p>
<p>You can also look at the room from any icon of the Listeners
Seats by clicking on the Look from Listener Seat icon and then selecting one of
the Listener Seats from the selection window that opens.</p>
<p>Notice that in all these views you can also manipulate (turn and
rotate) the view to look at different parts of the room.</p>
<p><b>Using the Walker</b></p>
<p>No tour of an actual room would be complete without walking
around the room and EASE allows you to do just that with the Walker. All you
need to do is click on the Walker icon</p>
<p><img width=582 height=339
src="E1.files/image043.jpg"></p>
<p>If the Walker window is obscuring the graphics, use your mouse
to move it. Notice that a small x, y, z icon has been added to the room
graphic. It shows you the location of the Walker. You can change the location,
by changing the coordinate information in the dialog win-dow or by using the
mouse cursor to grab the x, y, z icon and physically move it.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>If you decide to physically move it, you first will have change
the operating mode of the Mouse. Use key command <i>“p”</i> to switch to the
Pick mode or the <i>Mouse</i> pull down menu. Then you will be able to grab the
x, y, z icon and move it to any location you want.</p>
<p>Note that if you were going step by step through the Tutorial,
the Walker was probably placed at the insertion point of the Main loud-speaker,
the last location selected in the Eyes program. You may have to Zoom In on the
Main loudspeaker to see it as the icon is quite small. A way to avoid this is
to use the cursor to Pick the spot where you want to insert the Walker. The
Walker will automatically open at that spot.</p>
<p><img width=248 height=179
src="E1.files/image044.jpg"></p>
<p>The arrow buttons in the Walker control panel above and below
the Go To button (the pointing finger icon) allow you to move up and down. The
other 4 buttons allow you to move to the right or left and forward or backward
in the room; use the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen to turn your head
and the right scroll bar to look up or down.</p>
<p>To view the room from the Walker location, click on the <i>Eye</i>
icon. It toggles between the Walker (Orthographic and Perspective) viewpoints.
If all you see is a blank wall, it's probably because your head is turned and
you are looking at the rear of the room instead of the front. Use the bottom
scroll bar to turn your head until you can see the front of the room. Take a
walk around, you'll enjoy it.</p>
<p>Note: Even if you do not have EARS, you can also initiate a
direct sound auralization by clicking on the <i>Ear</i> icon. This is true for
both EASE and EASE JR. If you have EASE, you can also activate the Acoustical
Probe from the Walker control menu by clicking on the <i>Microphone </i>icon.
EASE users can by pressing the Lightning symbol button, also initiate a Ray
Tracing Impact study at the Walker location.<i> </i>For users having AURA, the
Aura button opens AURA for a monaural Impulse response study at the Walker
position.</p>
<p><b>Electro-Acoustic Calculations (Room Mapping)</b></p>
<p>The last stop on our quick overview of EASE will be the
Electro-Acoustic Simulation or Mapping portion of the program. EASE and EASE JR
offer two basic methods of displaying (mapping) the electro-acoustic
performance of the model and its loudspeaker system; Area Map-ping and Room
Mapping.</p>
<p>Room Mapping is accessible from either the Eyes rendering module
or from the Main window by selecting <i>Room Mapping</i> from the <i>Calcu-lations
</i>pull down menu. Since we are already in the Eyes module, we’ll start there.
The bottom row of Tool Bars in the Eyes window pro-vide direct access to the
mapping functions. First, use your mouse and the cursor to find the <i>Direct
SPL</i> button and then click on it. This will initiate the mapping routine by
bringing up the following setup window.</p>
<p>All EASE simulations are based upon a number of setup
parameters. For example, the program needs to know what loudspeakers will be
used and at what frequency the simulation should be run. The Mapping setup
window and the two that follow take you step by step through the points that
need to be considered. We’ll review all of the setup parameters in detail later
on in this tutorial. For now, since we are just taking a quick tour we’ll
accept most of the default settings.</p>

<p>The only change we need to make in this window is to select the
Loudspeakers we want to use. Clicking on the <i>Lsp</i>k button will bring up a
selection menu. Select <i>Main</i> and <i>OK</i>. We’ll use only the Main
loudspeaker in our example. If we wanted to use all the loud-speakers, right
clicking on <i>OK</i> in the selection window would have selected all of them.</p>
<p>Note that <i>All Mappings</i> is checked. When <i>All Mappings</i>
is turned on, the program will gather all the information it needs to map all
measures at all frequencies. When <i>Single</i> is checked, information for
only the selected measure at the chosen frequency is gathered. It takes only
slightly longer for All Mappings than for a Single map, so most users
automatically use All Mappings all the time.</p>

<p>Now press <i>Next</i> to open the second (Items) setup window.</p>
<p><img width=376 height=664

<p>The Items setup window is where the room elements that will be
used in the simulation are selected.</p>
<p>For our first simulation we want to map on all the Au-dience
Areas, so no changes are necessary in this window. All we need to do is to make
sure <i>On Areas</i> is checked in the <i>Mapping section</i> and all the <i>Audi-ence
Areas </i>are selected under<i> Audience Areas In Use</i>. Pressing the<i>
Audience Area </i>button will bring up<i> </i>a listing of all the Audience
Areas included in the model. All you need to do is to select all of them if
they aren’t already selected.</p>
<p>Note: If you turned Off the Audience Areas in the previous room
rendering exercise, you will need to go to the <i>Items</i> pull down menu and
turn them back On. EASE will not map on Audience Areas that are turned Off.</p>
<p>Press Next to advance to the Noise setup window, which allows
you to set the noise levels used in the intelligibility simulations. For now,
accept the default settings. We’ll cover this EASE feature in detail in the
Room Investigations section of this manual.</p>
<p>Press <i>Next</i> to advance to the Calculation setup win-dow
where the nature of the simulation is defined. Note that you have the
opportunity to map either with or without Shadowing and with either a Sinus
(single frequency) signal or in third octave bands.</p>
<p>Make sure <i>Map With Shadows</i> is selected. We want to see
how much of the main floor Audience Areas under the balcony is shadowed from
the Main Speaker by the balcony.</p>
<p>We’ll stick with the other settings for now. Click on <i>OK </i>to
start the simulation.</p>
<p>When the simulation is complete the program will map the results
on the Audience Areas and open a View Calculation window. Note that the View
Calcu-lation window blocks the main screen making it im-possible to see the
Audience Areas.</p>
<p><img width=379 height=221
src="E1.files/image047.jpg"></p>
<p>Minimize it by clicking on the Minimize Icon in the left corner
of the View Calculation window and then use your Mouse to drag it to a location
which allows you to see the mapping.</p>
<p>We’ll come back to the purpose of the Calculation window when we
get to the Room Investigations section of the manual.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>As you can see, the results of the simulation have been “mapped”
on the Audience Areas. The black section at the rear of the under balcony area
defines the area being shadowed from the main cluster by the balcony. The jagged
front edge of this area is a sign we maybe should have used a higher resolution
in this simulation. When “Patches” are used, EASE scans the area patch by patch
and had difficulty cal-culating these patches since part of the patch was being
shadowed and part wasn’t.</p>
<p><img width=399 height=232
src="E1.files/image048.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the Intelligibility. Since we used All
Mappings, all we have to do is go to minimized Calcu-lations window and use the
drop down arrow to change <i>Direct SPL</i> to <i>Articulation Loss</i>
(Alcons) and then press the bright colored Render Map icon. The Alcons map will
appear almost instantly; all EASE had to do was to render the map, it had
already done the calculations.</p>
<p>Notice the shadowed area under the balcony is red while
everything else is light green. In Alcons, light green is good while red
indicates the program was unable to calculate the articulation loss because of
the shadow.</p>
<p><img width=399 height=232
src="E1.files/image049.jpg"></p>
<p>Now let’s try mapping on the Room surfaces. First, go to the
menu bar, select <i>Items</i> and turn off the <i>Audi-ence Areas</i>. Then
press the<i> Waste Basket </i>icon in the<i> View Calculation </i>window to
waste the existing calcu-lation file and start a new calculation by pressing on
the <i>Direct SPL</i> icon. leave the first setup window un-changed. In the
second one, turn off <i>On Areas</i> and check <i>On Faces</i>. Next go to the <i>Faces
In Use</i> sec-tion, press the <i>Faces</i> button and select all the Faces.
Note that you have the option of choosing only a few of the Faces if that is
what you want. <i>OK</i> the setup and run the simulation.</p>
<p>Notice that the black area at the rear of the under bal-cony
area has disappeared and now there is one at the front of the balcony. The
floor at the rear of the under balcony area is not shadowed, even though the
ears of anyone seated there would be. In a similar fashion, listeners seated in
the front row of the bal-cony would not be shadowed by the face of the bal-cony
even though the floor under them would be.</p>
<p><img width=399 height=232
src="E1.files/image050.jpg"></p>
<p>Use the scroll bars and other viewing tools to turn and rotate
the room. Note the hot spot on the ceiling di-rectly over the cluster.</p>
<p>Note that EASE JR users will only be able to map Di-rect SPL in
Room Mapping. EASE users can map all the other simulations in Room Mapping, but
EASE JR users can’t.</p>

<p><b>Area Mapping</b></p>
<p>Area Mapping (it’s also called Standard Mapping) porvides the
same electro-acoustic measures as Room Mapping, eccept it displays them only on
the Audience Areas. The Direct SPL map shown below is identical to the one we
viewed in Room Mapping presented in a different fashion.</p>
<p><img width=605 height=436
src="E1.files/image051.jpg"></p>
<p>One advantage of Area Mapping is that the Audience Areas can be
moved around to eliminate one Audience Area from partially overlap-ping or
completely blocking your view of another Audience Area. In this graphic, for
example, the Balcony Audience Area (the Audience Area at the bottom of the
screen) has been moved so it does not overlap any portion of the two main floor
Audience Areas.</p>
<p>Moving the Audience Areas is accomplished in the Edit Project
module. To see how it works, go back to the Edit Project window and select <i>Area
Layout </i>from the<i> Edit </i>pull down menu. Then select<i> Move </i>from
the<i> Edit </i>pull down menu and move the Audience Areas around by grab-bing
them with the pliers tool. It’s easy to do.</p>
<p>Without the normal 3D view it’s easy to lose track of which
Audience Area is which. To prevent this most users give them a name when they
are created and turn on the Audience Area Labels when they are using Area
Mapping. Use your cursor to find the A<i>udience Areas</i> <i>Labe</i>l icon in
the tool bar section and turn the labels<i> On</i>.</p>
<p>While running these simulations you may have noticed that there
have been colors in some of the renderings that did not appear in the Color
Legend chart at the side of the screen. The reason is that the Color Legend
chart has a range of only 20 dB while the range of the display is much greater.
If this presents a problem for you, go to the <i>View</i> tab in the <i>Options</i>
menu (right click on the screen and select <i>Op-tions </i>or hit<i> F9 </i>and
then select the<i> View </i>tab). Check<i> Auto Show Legends Window </i>and hit<i>
Apply </i>to insert a color legend with a scroll bar that<i> </i>enables you to
identify all the colors. If you want to use this one instead of the one with a
limited range, uncheck <i>Auto Show Legends</i> and leave <i>Auto Show Legends
Window</i> selected. Then click on <i>OK</i>. Note that this same folder gives
you control of the Parameters usually shown in the upper left corner of the
screen.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>Chapter 2: Overview</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>Be aware that if you turn off these item’s auto insert commands
in the Option folder you can still manually insert them by going to the <i>Utili-ties
</i>pull down menu and clicking on the appropriate command.</p>
<p>Let’s do one more simulation before we move on to building a
model. This time let’s take a close look at the balcony coverage being
pro-vided by the three Delay loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Click on the <i>Recalculate Map</i> icon (it’s the explanation
point symbol at the left end of the lower tool bar section) to initiate a new
calcula-tion. In the opening setup window you’ll need to change from the Main
Loudspeaker to the three Delay loudspeakers. Click on one of the Delay
loudspeakers and then hold down the <i>Ctrl</i> key while you select the other
two. Press <i>Next</i>. In the second setup window you will need to turn Off
all the Audience Areas except for the Balcony Audience Area. Make the change
and hit <i>OK</i> to start the simulation.</p>
<p>The resultant Map may be a little difficult to interpret, so
lets try mapping in Isolines instead of by by Patches. Find the Isolines Icon
in the tool bar section (it’s just to the right of the STI icon) and click on
it. EASE will then redraw the Map in Isolines which may be a little easier to
read. The Isoline Map is shown below.</p>
<p><img width=600 height=427
src="E1.files/image052.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice the interference pattern between the three delay line
loudspeakers. Investigate it by turning and rotating the graphic to get a
better view.</p>
<p>If you have time, rerun the simulation using Sinus and
one-octave signals and note the differences. Try other combinations, too, to
get a feel for this portion of the program.</p>

<p>Now it is time to begin a new project. Open EASE and either
select the <i>File</i> pull down menu in the Main menu bar and choose <i>New</i>
<i>Projec</i>t or use the Desk Top icons (<i>Start working/Create
Project/Create Empty Project</i>). Either method will open the Project Options
win-dow shown below.</p>
<p>We will be doing several tutorial models and it would be nice to
have them stored in the same &quot;Tutorial&quot; folder. To accomplish this,
insert &quot;Tutorial&quot; in the Hall field. Then insert &quot;Model_1&quot;,
the name of the room we will be building, in the <i>Project File Name</i>
field. This will create a Tutorial folder in the location shown in the Project
Path field and store all the files we will be creating in that folder as

<p>.Now, go to the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu and select <i>Project

Project window shown below.</p>
<p><img width=538 height=390

<p><b>It is important to note at this point that any work done on a
project under Edit Project will not be saved unless the changes are first
checked under Edit Project, which automatically sends the changes to the Main

and Save</i> key command comes into play. It checks the data, sends the changes
to the EASE Main program and saves them to protect against your work being lost
if you inadvertently exit the program.</b></p>
<p><img width=301 height=352
src="E1.files/image057.jpg"></p>
<p>Before we actually start to build the model there are several
setup parame-ters we should check. Right click on the blank screen to open the
Mouse Menu. Then select <i>Room Data</i> to open the Edit Room Data window.
Open the <i>Data</i> tab. Then type in the project's name (Model_1) in the <i>Project
Ver-sion </i>field, its location in the<i> Town </i>field and add any notes
concerning the<i> </i>project you would like to store with it.</p>
<p>We should note here that the Hall name would be the same as the
Project Version name, if only one project was going to be stored in the
Tutorial folder. But, we wanted to provide for storing several models in the
Tutorial folder. Hence, the names are different. Both names can be as long as
40 characters.</p>
<p>Next, make sure the <i>Room Open</i> and <i>Room Symmetric</i>
boxes are checked. Room modeling is normally done in the Room Open mode, since
when the Room is Closed (not open) the program expects the room to be complete
and routinely checks for Holes, missing Faces, Non-Planar Faces, etc. whenever
you check data or exit the program. This generates numerous Error Messages when
the model is under construction and many elements are missing.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The way to prevent most of these messages is to do the modeling
in the Room Open mode and then “Close” the Room after it is complete. In the
Room Open mode, the program mainly checks for Non-Planar Faces (Faces that are
not flat). When the Room is Closed, the Check Data operation is far more
detailed.</p>
<p>When the Room Symmetric mode is on during room modeling, EASE
will automatically add mirror image Vertices, Edges, Faces, Loud-speakers,
Audience Areas, Listener Seats, Lamps and IR Devices . This cuts the modeling
time in half as you only have to model one side of the room; EASE puts in the
other side for you. It is common practice to first model all symmetrical
aspects of the room while in the Room Symmetric mode and then switch to the
Non-Symmetric mode to add any non-symmetrical items.</p>
<p>We’ll look into the Mapping and Settings tabs later. For now,
the changes we made are sufficient. Click <i>OK</i> to approve the changes.</p>

<p><b>Wall Material Databases.</b></p>
<p>Now would be a good time to become familiar with the Speaker and
Wall Material databases.</p>
<p>We don’t need to load the Wall Materials and Loud-speakers we
will be using in this project at this time, since we’ll have the opportunity to
load them individu-ally as we construct the model and add Walls (Faces) and
Loudspeakers (Speakers) to the Room. However, before we start the Model we
should have a good idea of what Wall Materials are used in the Room and what
Loudspeakers we would like to try out to see how well they will perform, and
it’s usually more efficient to build the project’s data base at this time.</p>
<p>In the Edit Project window select <i>Select Project
Data-base/Select Speaker Models </i>from the<i> Edit </i>pull down<i> </i>menu.</p>
<p>When the Select Project Database/Speaker Models window opens,
browse to <i>EASE40Data/Global Speak-ers40/ </i>and the Manufacturer whose
loudspeaker(s)<i> </i>you intend to use.</p>
<p><img width=342 height=289
src="E1.files/image059.jpg"></p>
<p>Select a loudspeaker model and press <i>Add&gt;&gt;</i> to load
the Loudspeaker into the Project Database. Repeat the process until you have
selected all the loudspeakers you plan to use in the project. Note that you can
select multiple loudspeakers at the same time by holding down the left mouse
button and scrolling or by holding down the <i>Ctr</i>l key while selecting
different loudspeak-ers.</p>
<p>Then press <i>Select All</i> in the Project Database side of the

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=348
src="E1.files/image062.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Room Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p>One of the first steps in modeling any room is to form a clear
picture of the room, either on paper or in your mind. A few minutes studying
the information you have to work with and sketching the room can save you hours
of modeling time. EASE offers several methods of mod-eling a room and deciding
what method to use is an important decision. You need to have a clear idea of
how you are going to proceed be-fore you start.</p>
<p>The Prototype method is based on the use of pre-built prototype
rooms that can be easily resized and otherwise modified. This method is a great
time saver, when your room is similar to one of the Prototypes. We’ll
investigate the use of Prototypes later.</p>
<p>EASE also has the ability to create a number of complex shapes,
such as cubes, domes, cylinders and pyramids. If your room has curved surfaces
or includes columns, you'll want to consider using Create Shapes as a means of
reducing the modeling time. Examples of the use of Create Shapes in
constructing complex rooms can be found starting on page 106.</p>
<p>If the room you are about to model is similar to one you have
done before, saving the existing room under another name using the Save As
command and then modifying it is another possible way to save time.</p>
<p>You can also import 3-D models from Sketchup or AutoCad into
your project and use them as the basis for your model.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the model can be built point by point
(Vertex by Vertex) and Face by Face until it is completed using x, y, z
coordinates. It's also possible to start with one method, Prototypes for
example, and then add unusual features with Create Shapes and finish the model
using the x, y, z coordinate method.</p>
<p>Your choice will depend upon how close one of the prototypes or
existing rooms is to the new room and on how detailed a model is needed. In the
early stages of a project, for example, only a quick look at the direct sound
coverage offered by the loudspeaker system being considered may be needed. This
doesn't require a detailed model.</p>
<p>Another consideration is who will be looking at the printouts.
There is no reason to spend a lot of time including in your model minute room
details like doors and windows that usually don't materially affect the overall
acoustics, unless you want to impress a client with a nice looking model.
Another factor to consider is whether or not the room is symmetrical. If it is,
the EASE symmetry feature can cut your modeling time in half. You enter an item
on one side of the room and EASE will place an identical one on the other side
of the room.</p>
<p>Since the x, y, z coordinate method is used to modify the rooms
in the other methods, we will use this procedure to construct our first</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>In the X, Y, Z coordinate method each surface area (called a
Face in the program) is constructed by connecting together the points
(Ver-tices) which outline its area. The points (Vertices) are identified by
their location in the x, y, z coordinate system. The 3D drawing of a 2 foot
square cube shown below illustrates the coordinate system.</p>
<p><img width=455 height=326
src="E1.files/image063.jpg"></p>
<p>The graphic below shows how the cube drawing will appear in
EASE. Note the red, blue and green x, y, z axis lines and the red dots which
identify the corner points (Vertices).</p>
<p><img width=454 height=284
src="E1.files/image064.jpg"></p>
<p>The plane of symmetry for data input in EASE can be any plane
parallel to the yz plane. All values of x are possible, including x = 0, which
is used in the illustration. When the Symmetry option is on, all items
(Vertices, Edges and Faces) entered in the negative x part of the Room will
automatically be mirrored (entered into the program) in the positive x part of
the Room. The reverse also holds true; items en-tered in the positive x part of
the Room will be mirrored in the negative x part.</p>

<p><b>Room Entry</b></p>
<p>Many experienced users begin a project by using a red pencil to
draw in the x, y, z axis and the 0, 0, 0 point on a sketch of the room or on
the room drawings (blue prints). They then proceed to identify (circle in red)
the points they want to include in their drawing and write their coordinate
locations on the drawing. At the same time, they decide exactly how they are
going to proceed; for example, exactly where they will start their model.</p>
<p>Now, it's time to create a room model. A sketch of the room we
will be modeling appears below. The coordinates for the Vertices are shown to
help you get started.</p>
<p><img width=671 height=402
src="E1.files/image065.jpg"></p>
<p>Our sample room is 75 feet long and 50 feet wide. Its walls are
12 feet high and the overall height of the room at the peak of the roof is 25
feet.. Note that the unit of measurement is feet. The stage (Chancel) is
elevated 2 feet above the main floor and is reached by two steps that are 12
inches high and 12 inches deep. The shaded areas represent the seating areas.</p>
<p>We want the seating areas to be separate Faces, as this will
allow us to easily change their acoustical properties to represent different
size audiences. We'll use PUBINWDP to represent the congregation seated in pews
and MTSEATWD to represent empty seats. It will also make adding Audience Areas
easier when we reach that part of constructing a model.</p>
<p>The floors are covered with a commercial grade carpet
(CARPTCOMM), three of the walls are painted brick (PNTD BRICK), the wall
be-hind the stage is smooth plaster (PLAST/LTHS) and the ceiling (roof) and
peaks are wood paneling (WOODFLR).</p>
<p>The shaded seating areas in our tutorial room could be modeled into
the floor, but this a lot more difficult than simply pasting (in EASE
ter-minology &quot;Coating&quot;) them onto the floor after the room is built.</p>
<p>You may want to copy this page, so you'll have it ready for easy
reference as you construct the model.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The completed model as it will appear in EASE is shown below.</p>
<p>We could easily model this room using either the Church(A)
prototype or the Auditory w/Peaked Roof prototype. We could also model it using
Create Shapes by first creating a Cuboid the size of the room and then adding
the roof as a Pyramid. Both approaches would quickly give us models almost
identical to the sample room and needing only a few modifications to become
identical.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E1.files/image066.jpg"></p>
<p>The Church(A) room, for example, has a two foot high Chancel
(stage), but no steps (refer to the drawing below). The steps would have to be
added for the two rooms to be identical. While considering this you would have
to ask yourself how important the steps are acousti-cally.</p>
<p>Additionally, both the front and rear walls are drawn as a
single entity and would have to redrawn as two Faces since the wall materials
are different. The seating areas would also have to be added. None of these
changes are a big deal once you have mastered the art of room modeling and an
experienced user could easily make the changes in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>The <i>Auditory w/Peaked Roo</i>f prototype (see below) is very
similar to <i>Church(A)</i>. The main difference is that the Chancel area,
although drawn in as a separate area, is not elevated two feet. It's at floor
level. This room, too, could be easily converted into a room identical to the
drawing.</p>
<p><img width=534 height=333
src="E1.files/image068.jpg"></p>
<p>Since modifying these rooms requires knowledge of the coordinate
system and EASE modeling techniques, we will first model the room using the
coordinate method.</p>
<p>Most EASE users model a room in the same order it would be
physically built; i.e., they first model the floor, then they erect the walls
and after that add the ceiling/roof. The final step is to put in the finishing
touches, such as the seating areas, windows and doors. Other users leave the
ceiling (roof) to last. It is up to you.</p>
<p>We will be doing most of our modeling using the 3-D view.
Experienced 3-D CAD users may feel more comfortable using the OmniView window
which lends itself to more graphic modeling techniques. We’ll try this out
later.</p>

<p>Before we start the drawing, let's check the Option settings to
get a feeling for the many options available to you and to make sure they are
set the way you would like to have them set. Select <i>Options</i> from the <i>File

<p>In the <i>Genera</i>l tab (see next page) change the Background
color from gray to white. Use the .button next to the Background color field
to open the color selector. Select white or any color you would like to use and
then use <i>Apply</i> to look at the difference in the drawing and then go back
to gray. Some users like to switch to white before printing as it re-duces the
printing time, because the printer doesn't have to spend time printing the gray
background. You can choose any color you like. Make your choice and then press <i>OK</i>.</p>

<p>Next, open the <i>View</i> tab. Note that in the <i>Redraw</i>
section, both <i>While</i> <i>Scrolling </i>and<i> While Dragging </i>are<i> </i>checked.
This allows you to see how far you have moved the model while you are scrolling
or dragging it across the screen. Unless they are checked, you won't know how
far you have moved the model until you stop. You may want to use <i>Apply </i>to
see the difference.</p>
<p><img width=478 height=876
src="E1.files/image070.jpg"></p>
<p>Under <i>Auto Refit</i>, we suggest mak-ing sure the <i>Full
after Resize</i> box is checked. Otherwise, whenever you open the Room Editor
module and Maximize the screen, the room model will need to be resized
man-ually using the Full icon.</p>
<p>If the <i>Full after Turn</i> and <i>Full after View</i> boxes
are checked, when-ever you Zoom in on a section of the model and then either
turn the model or change the view to get an</p>
<p>even better look, the model will re-vert to its full size.
You'll have to de-cide how you want this portion of the program to work.</p>
<p>You may want to change the Axes Length. All we want is an icon
on the screen to keep us oriented. We don't need ones that are several hundred
feet long. If you want, change them to a more reasonable length, 10 or 20 feet
for example, and hit <i>Apply</i>.</p>
<p>Next, open the <i>Pick</i> tab and make sure that at least the <i>Vertices
of</i> <i>Picked Face </i>option is checked<i> </i>under <i>Highlight Item</i>.
Hit <i>Apply</i>.</p>
<p>Now open the <i>Prompts</i> tab and under <i>Insert Face - Add
Vertex</i> change the selection to <i>Never Add Vertex</i>. This change
prevents the inadver-tent adding of Vertices while adding a Face. Hit <i>Apply.</i></p>
<p>Next, let's change the <i>Step Width</i> under the <i>Editing</i>
tab to a much smaller value (if you will be modeling in feet, .03 feet for
example.) The smaller value is useful when you are using the arrow keys to
position two loudspeakers side by side. Hit <i>Apply</i>.</p>

<p>And finally, open the <i>Grid</i> tab and make sure everything
under <i>Snap To</i> <i>Grid </i>is selected and the<i> Snap Resolution </i>is
set to a smaller value (0.5<i> </i>feet is recommended). These changes will
make it easier to fully utilize the graphic drawing capabilities of EASE. Then,
approve all the selec-tions you have made in the Options folder by clicking on <i>OK</i>
and return to the Edit Project window.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=260

<p>Before we start, let's do one more thing. Right click on the
screen to open the Mouse Menu and then select Grid. Notice that this takes you
directly to the Grid tab in the Options folder. This time in the Single View
Grid section, put a check in the <i>Z-Grid</i> box and then hit Apply.</p>
<p>Note that a Grid has now been added to the screen. Many users
like to do their modeling with this Grid turned On as it helps them keep their
perspective. The choice of using it or not is up to you. If you want to use it,
hit <i>OK</i>. If not, remove the check in the Z-Grid box and then click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p><img width=673 height=488

<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Entering Vertices</b></p>
<p>The Vertices we will be using to construct our room have been
circled in our Tutorial room drawing and coordinates for most of the Vertices
are given. Note that the corner points under the raised stage have not been
circled. They are not part of the room and won't be included in the model. We
are only interested in the inside of the room.</p>
<p>Please note that we placed the 0, 0, 0 point in the center of
the stage at the very rear of the room. In EASE we normally use either the back
of the stage or the wall behind the stage for y= 0. This places the Audience
Areas at negative y. This is desirable because (by de-fault) EASE aims
loudspeakers along the negative y axis. We strongly recommend that you follow
these conventions; otherwise some confusion (and accompanying waste of time)
may result.</p>
<p>Let's start. Go to the Main Menu and open the Model_1 room under
Edit Room. Maximize the screen if it isn't already maximized. The larger the
drawing, the easier it's going to be to work. The working area of the screen
will be displaying only the x, y, z axes icon, unless you decided to use the
Z-Grid.</p>
<p>The first Face we want to enter is the main floor. There are a
number of ways to enter a Face in EASE and before we finish the Tutorial we'll
try all of them. For now, we'll use the basic method which is to enter the
Vertices and then connect them together to form the Face. We'll be helped by
the symmetry feature of EASE because we will only have to insert 2 Vertices and
EASE will put in the other two.</p>
<p>Note: Most of the operations we will be performing can be
initiated through use of one of the Tool Bar icons, by a key command or by
using the Insert pull down menu. Both the Tool Bar icons and the key commands
will be used throughout the Tutorial to get you acquainted with them. The Key
Command will normally follow the command name in brackets, for example, <i>[F3]</i>.</p>
<p>Before we do this, make sure the <i>Show Vertex</i> icon is
activated (click on it in the Tool Bar) Unless Show Vertex is turned on, you
will not be able to see the Vertices as you add them. You may also want to turn
on <i>Vertex Labe</i>l. It will allow you to see the P numbers assigned to the
Vertices as you add them.</p>
<p>Now, click on the <i>Insert Vertex icon [V]</i> in the tool bar
and then on any spot in the screen. This will open the Properties sheet for the
Ver-tex. Type in the coordinates for the first Vertex (-25, -20, 0) and then
hit <i>OK</i>. Note that you can tab from one entry field to the next.</p>
<p><img width=340 height=230
src="E1.files/image073.jpg"></p>
<p>It's quite likely that after doing this you will be able to see
only one Vertex on the screen, even though you are working in the symmetrical
mode and EASE should have put in a second mirror image Vertex. It did, you just
can't see it! Either go to the tool bar section and click on the <i>Full icon
[Home]</i> or use the Scroll Bars <i>[F11</i>] to resize the drawing so you can
see both Vertex P1 and its mirror image Vertex P1*.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Adding the next Vertex is easy. Vertex P1 should still be
selected (highlighted in yellow). If it isn't select it and then click the
right mouse button and select <i>Duplicate</i> from the pop up Mouse menu that
appears This will open the Displacement window shown below (unless under
Options you changed the default settings under the Prompts tab.) It is asking
for the location of the new (duplicate) Vertex.</p>
<p><img width=571 height=223
src="E1.files/image074.jpg"></p>
<p>All you have to do is type in how far you want the Vertex moved;
in this case 55 feet down the Y axis (from -20 to -75). Enter -55. Approving
the move will introduce the Edit Vertex screen shown above giving you the
opportunity to check and approve the Vertex location. This is a quick way to
add Vertices, since you usually have to type in only one figure.</p>
<p>The Displacement screen also has a <i>Keep</i> check box and a <i>Repeated</i>
field. When <i>Keep</i> is checked the coordinate entries are stored and appear
the next time Duplicate/Displace is used. At times this can be a time saver.</p>
<p>The Repeated field allows you to repeat the Duplicate/Displace
operation a number of times. It's not used very often with Vertices, but is an
extremely useful feature when Faces, Objects and Loudspeakers are being
Duplicated/Displaced. We'll work with it later on in this Tutorial.</p>
<p>Note that the Displacement screen shown above also has three
fields for Polar Coordinates. These are used for angular displacements. If we
had wanted to displace the Vertex 5 feet at a 30 degree angle, we would have
entered 30 in the hor. field and 5 in the dist. field. The program would have
responded by telling you how far the Vertex would be moved in the x &amp; y
direction.</p>
<p>We'll be working with Polar Coordinates in this Tutorial. They
can be very helpful and you need to become familiar with what can be done with
them.</p>
<p>Note: While constructing the model, you will probably notice
that the coordinate numbers occasionally change slightly from the ones you
entered; for example, -20 became -20.01. EASE works in the Metric system and
converts to feet when the modeling is being done in feet. The variations are
the result of rounding.</p>
<p>At this stage you'll probably be able to see all 4 Vertices, but
not the x, y, z axis icon. <i>Zoom Out [F12] [Home]</i> until you can see the
icon. It's easy to become disoriented unless you can see the Axis icon. If you
aren't sure which Vertex is which, go to the Label Items tool bar and click on
the Vertex icon. This will add the Vertex numbers to the screen. We suggest
leaving them On.</p>
<p><b>Entering Faces</b></p>
<p>The next step is to create the Face that will represent the floor.
Go to the Tool Bars and click on <i>Insert Face [f]</i>. Then click on Vertex
P1, P1*, P2* and P2 in order. Note that a red Trace line follows the movement
of the cursor after you have selected the first Vertex. Get into the habit of
watching this Trace line as you enter Faces.</p>
<p>You will also hear a tone signal as you click on each Vertex.
This is the program's way of telling you that you selected the Vertex and not
somewhere close to it.</p>
<p>Note, if you did not previously select <i>Never Add Vertex</i>
while setting the Exit Project Options (page 51) and missed the Vertex, the
program will give you a Prompt asking if you want to add a Vertex. Since we
don’t want to add a new Vertex, answer No by hitting the Cancel but-ton. The
program is just letting you know you missed the Vertex.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=672 height=426
src="E1.files/image075.jpg"></p>
<p>As soon as the Face is completed a Create Face Prompt will
appear asking if you want to Save the Face. Note that you only had to define 3
of the edges of the Face before the prompt appeared. Ease put in the fourth one
for you.</p>
<p><img width=365 height=378
src="E1.files/image076.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that we used a clockwise rotation to enter the Face and
that the Face is outlined in yellow. Our using a clockwise rotation told the
program that we were entering a Face whose active (exposed) surface faced into
the room as we viewed it. The yellow outline indicates that this is the way the
Face is oriented.</p>
<p>To verify this (and to get a little practice), let's blow away
(delete) the Face we just created and enter it again using a counter clockwise
rotation. Answer <i>Yes</i> to the Create Face prompt and then <i>OK</i> the
Edit Face window that opens. We can delete the Face by selecting it and using
the <i>Delete</i> key on the keyboard or by using the UnDo tool in the Tool
Bar. This time click on P1* first, then P1, P2 and P2* in that order.. Notice
that after we finish, the Face is now outlined in white. Use the Invert Face
icon in the Tool Bar to invert it or use the Mouse Menu and se-lect Invert.
Note that the outline color changes from white to yellow.</p>
<p>Note: Many users pay little attention to the direction in which
they enter the Vertices into the Face and rely upon the outline color to tell
them whether it’s entered properly or not. If it’s not, they invert it using
the right mouse but-ton and the <i>Invert</i> command.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, reopen the Properties window for the Face. Right click on
the Face and then select <i>Properties from the</i> <i>Mouse Menu </i>The
properties window gives you the op-portunity to define the Face’s
characteristics, such as its color and its surface material.</p>
<p><img width=310 height=321
src="E1.files/image077.jpg"></p>
<p>To designate the color of the Face, click in the Color field
under Materials or on the . button beside the Color field and then select the
color from the color chart that appears. Don’t be surprised when the color of
the Face on the screen does not change. Face colors are visible only under
Rendering. Because of this, some users wait to add color to the Faces until the
model is complete. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>To apply the color change, click on either <i>Apply</i> or <i>OK</i>.
Apply will make the change, but not close the window. OK will make the change
and close the window. The green traffic light at the bottom of the screen
indicates the Checked status of the File and shows that the file is open to
accept changes. Left clicking on the green light will open a pop up screen
telling you whether the data is good or not. The yellow envelope indicates that
the file has been altered, but that the change has not been processed. Clicking
on <i>Apply</i> will process the change and wipe out the envelope.</p>
<p><img width=365 height=227
src="E1.files/image078.jpg"></p>
<p>To pick the surface material, click in the white Face field or
on the . button beside the Face field to open the Select Wall Material window
and then select the mate-rial you want to use. You'll notice that the only material
listed is the default Absorber. CARPTCOMM which is what we want isn't listed.
This means you will have to use the Browse button to locate the Material
database and find CARPTCOMM so you can add it to the data-base for this
project.</p>
<p><img width=369 height=309
src="E1.files/image079.jpg"></p>
<p>Pressing <i>Browse</i> will take you directly to the Wall
Mate-rials folder in the Select Project Database window. Browse to the <i>American
Base</i> and open the <i>Full</i> folder. Scroll through the list to find
CARPTCOMM, select it and then press <i>Add</i> to add CARPTCOMM to the Proj-ect
Database.</p>
<p>Follow the same procedure to add the other materials we will be
using in this project to the project database.</p>
<p>Then return to the Properties screen for the Face we in-serted,
choose CARPTCOMM and click on OK.</p>
<p>Don't worry about the other boxes in the Properties win-dow.
We'll cover them later.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Making Steps</b></p>
<p>Now, it's time to add the steps. This won't be as difficult as
it may sound. From the room description, we know the steps are 1 foot (12 inches)
high and 1 foot deep, so all we have to do is use the Duplicate feature to
create new Vertices and then move the Vertices in the Displacement window. We
don't even need to know the coordinates for the new Vertices.</p>
<p>Lets do it. Left click on Vertex P1 and then open the Mouse menu
by right clicking. Select <i>Duplicate</i> from the folder that opens, and then
change the z dimension by typing 1 into the z field and hit <i>OK</i>. This
brings up the Property Sheet for the new Vertex complete with the co-ordinate
information. All you need to do is <i>OK</i> it.</p>
<p>Warning; one thing you need to watch out for is that the
Displacement window which comes up carries the displacement data from its
pre-vious use. You need to check all the fields to make sure they are what you
want.</p>
<p>Note that the new Vertex assumes the P2 designation and the
Vertex previously labeled P2 become P3. When the Duplicate method is used to
generate a new Vertex, EASE assigns the new Vertex the next highest number
above the number of the Vertex being duplicated and renumbers all higher number
Vertices. Note that the same holds true when Duplicating other items, such as
Faces.</p>
<p>Now, right click on Vertex P2 and select Duplicate again and
move the y coordinate by 1 foot (type 1 in the y box). This puts in the bottom
rear Vertex for the first step as P3. To put in the Vertex for the front of the
stage, repeat the procedure and change the z coordinate by 1.</p>
<p>If you have trouble &quot;picking&quot; the Vertices or have
difficulty seeing them, use the Zoom tool to zoom in on them. Just click on the
Zoom tool icon and then use your mouse to draw a box around the area you want.
You also may want to use the Drag tool to move the drawing on the screen and
the scroll bars to enhance your view of the Vertices.</p>
<p>Now that we gone this far, we might as well put in the Vertices
at the back of the Chancel. Repeat the procedure and change the y coordi-nate
by 19. Click on <i>OK</i>. Your drawing should now look like this.</p>
<p><img width=653 height=408

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to create the Faces associated with these
Vertices. We'll use the same procedure we used to create the Face represent-ing
the main floor. Select the <i>Insert Face [F]</i> icon from the tool bar and
then click on Vertices P1, P2, P2* and P1* in that order. Use the Zoom feature
and the Scroll Bars to get a good look at the Vertices involved. If the Vertex
Labels obscure your vision, turn them Off using the Tool Bar icon.</p>
<p>Notice that you did not need to click on Vertex P1* to complete
the Face. The program made that connection for you. Now repeat the pro-cedure
to put in the bottom of the first step, the back of the step and finally the
floor of the stage.</p>
<p>If you have trouble seeing the Vertices for the back of the
Chancel (stage), use the <i>Drag tool [d]</i> to grab the drawing and move it
across the screen. Be sure to check the outline color of each Face as its
entered into the program to make sure it's properly oriented.</p>
<p>Note that if we were putting in more than a couple of steps, we
would probably have put in the Vertices for just the first step, created the
Faces and then Duplicated/Displaced the Faces to create the remaining steps.
We'll practice this later in the Tutorial.</p>
<p><img width=583 height=363
src="E1.files/image081.jpg"></p>
<p>We are now ready to build the walls. The first step will be to
put in the four Vertices that define the top of the walls (the bottom Vertices
are already in place.) Pick Vertex P5 and click the right mouse button, select <i>Duplicate</i>
and then change the Z coordinate by 10. Remem-ber the walls are 12&quot; high
and the stage is 2&quot; high. Repeat the procedure with P7 to put in the other
corner Vertex (P8 at -25, -75, 12).</p>
<p>Now, it's a simple matter of adding the wall Faces. Select
Insert Face [f] from the Tool Bar and then click on the Vertices that outline
the side wall facing you. ( Vertices P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8 and P7 for
example.) If you can't read all the Vertex numbers, use the Zoom tool to take a
closer look at any you can't read.</p>
<p>Note that all the Vertices that define the wall Face must be
included in the Face. Otherwise, a Hole in the model will be created and you
won't be able to Close the Room until the Hole is Fixed. This is important as
many of the acoustic simulations can't be run until the room is closed.</p>
<p>Now, check the outline color to make sure the wall is properly
oriented. The wall closest to you should be outlined in white. If it isn't (and
it won’t be if you followed the instructions), use the Invert Face tool to
correct its orientation.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=671 height=365
src="E1.files/image082.jpg"></p>
<p>Now it's time to put in the walls at the end of the building.
The Vertices are all in place, so all we need to do is to connect them together
to make the Faces. Notice that you have to separately enter Faces for both ends
of the room. The symmetry feature of EASE only mirrors from one side of the
symmetry plane to the other. It doesn't work along the line of symmetry.</p>
<p>All that remains is to add the top sections of the end walls and
the roof. We'll start by inserting the two Vertices that represent the roof
peaks. This time lets use the Insert Vertex [Insert] [v] tool. Select the tool,
click on any screen location to insert the Vertex and type the proper
coordinates (0, 0, 25 for the stage end and 0, -75, 25 for the other end) into
the Property Sheets.</p>
<p>We'll first do the top sections of the walls at the ends of the
structure. Select the Insert Face [f} tool and then click on the three Vertices
that make up the Face. Don't forget to select the surface material (WOODFLR)
and choose a color. While adding these Faces, note the Invert Order button on
the Property Sheet. This represents another spot where you can change the Face
orientation.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>All that remains is to put in the ceiling. Use the Insert Face
[f] tool to do this. Select Insert Face, then click on the Vertices defining
one side of the ceiling. Don't forget to check the outline color of each Face
after it's added. Your completed room should like this.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=340
src="E1.files/image084.jpg"></p>
<p>We’ve completed the basic room. Now would be a good time to turn
off our computer and take a break. At this point, the work you have done hasn't
been saved or sent to the Main Program module. The simple way to do this is to
use the F6 key command; another way is to open the File pull down menu and
select Save Project Data.</p>
<p>Now, close up the Edit Project module and then EASE itself. If
you didn't remember to save the changes before you attempted to close EASE you
saw a prompt reminding you the data hadn't been saved. Answering Yes to the
Prompt will exit the program without saving the changes to the Project file.
Answering No to the prompt will give you the chance to save the data by
selecting Save under the File pull down menu or, by doing a Ctrl + s, or by
using the Save Icon in the Tool Bar.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that you always do an F6
before closing down the Edit Project module and then a Ctrl S before you
attempt to exit EASE. Why take a chance?</p>
<p>In fact, a good habit to get into is to regularly hit F6 while
you are building a model.</p>
<p><b>Adding Seating Areas (Using the Coat Feature)</b></p>
<p>Open the model again, if it isn't already open. Although the
Seating Area Faces that represent the seating areas could have been added at
any time during the modeling procedure, we put off adding them until now so we
could treat them separately. We want to &quot;paste&quot; them on top of the floor
instead of modeling them into it. EASE calls it making one Face a Coat of
another Face. The reason we want to use this method is that it is easier to
paste or Coat a Face onto another than it is to model one Face into another.
Modeling the two seating area Faces into the floor would have forced us to
generate a number of smaller &quot;partial&quot; Faces; pasting the Seating
Area Faces onto the floor generates only 2 new Faces.</p>
<p>The basic room is now complete, so let's paste in the Seating
Area Faces. We'll do this the same way we originally entered the floor. The
coordinates are shown in the drawing on page 48. First, Pick the main floor
Face and make note of its Face number. You will need it soon. Then select
Insert <i>Vertex [v]</i>, type in the coordinates for one of the four Vertices
we need to add and then <i>OK</i> the insertion. The other 3 Vertices can be
entered individually using the <i>Insert Vertex [v]</i> command or by using the
Duplicate/Displace method to create and position them.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>As soon as all four Vertices are added, select <i>Insert Face
[f]</i> from the tool bars and use the cursor to create the Face. When the
Properties sheet appears put a check in the Two Fold Face box. We'll start out
using MTSEAT WD as the material to simulate an empty room. Don't worry about
the Rear material. The rear material is ignored by EASE as long as the Face is
being Coated onto another. Next, put a check in the Is <i>Coat Of</i> box and
then click in the white field to the right of the Is <i>Coat Of</i> box. This
will open a listing of the Faces included in the model, select F1 (the
program's designation for the main floor Face) and <i>OK</i> the selection.
Then <i>OK</i> the overall listing and the Seating Areas will be Coated onto
the floor.</p>
<p>Note: You may be wondering why we went to the trouble of putting
in two seating area Faces and then Coating them onto the floor Face, instead of
just Coating a single Two Fold Face over the entire floor Face. The main reason
is that EASE has trouble when the Vertices for the Two Fold Face and the Face
being coated are shared. EASE wants to put the Two Fold Face a small distance
above the Face being Coated and can't when the Vertices are common. EASE tries
to correct this by shifting Vertices and strange things happen.</p>
<p>You may notice at this point that the Face outline is neither
white or yellow; instead it's blue or orange. Orange is the default color for
the foreside of a Two Fold Face. The backside is blue. If you don't like blue
or orange, changing to other colors is easy. Go to the <i>Options [F9]</i> menu
and select the <i>Items II Tab</i>. Click in the color box for <i>Face Color of
Picked Two-Fold</i> and select a new color.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=340
src="E1.files/image085.jpg"></p>
<p>We could have also created the seating areas with the Insert
Rectangle tool. In this approach, we would have gone to the z (overhead) view
and used the xy grid to graphically place the Vertices. Shift + z would have
opened the Grid folder in the Options menu and allowed us to turn on the grid
and set its plane level to the floor level.</p>
<p><b>When you place a Face on top of another Face, the Face on top
must be a Two-Fold Face and you must tell the program that you</b></p>
<p><b>want to Coat (paste) it onto another Face. </b>EASE
needs this information to correctly calculate the total surface area of the
Room and to<b> </b>make sure a hole isn't put into the Room. If you simply
create a Face and place it on top of another Face without using the Coat Of
fea-ture, the total surface area of the room is inflated throwing off many of
the calculations.</p>
<p>Two-Fold Faces are also used to add barriers, reflectors and
absorptive panels into a Room. These do not need to be Coated onto a Face, as
long as they do not touch another Face. When Two Fold Faces are used for this
purpose, the Rear Face material is also taken into ac-count in the room’s
surface area since both Faces are exposed to the Room.</p>

<p><b>Adding Audience Areas</b></p>
<p>Audience Areas are the imaginary areas on which EASE normally
maps the system's performance. They are strictly measuring planes and have no
acoustical properties.</p>
<p>Because we included Seating Area Faces in our room model, it
will be very easy to add Audience Areas. Pick one of the Seating Area Faces and
then right click on it to bring up the Mouse Menu. Choosing <i>Area Above Face</i>
will add the Audience Area and bring up the Audi-ence Area Property Sheet.. All
you need to do is click on <i>OK</i> and the Audience Areas will be added. They
will be outlined in green. Notice that the program has placed them directly
above the Seating Areas at a height of 3.94 feet, approximately the height of a
seated listener's ear.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=340
src="E1.files/image086.jpg"></p>
<p>The scanning routine used by EASE in its area mapping module
requires four-sided areas, so this method of adding audience areas works only
if the Audience Area is being placed above a Face having four corners; i.e., a
square, rectangle or quadrangle. Otherwise, the Audi-ence Area will have to be
entered as a special area with four corners. Use the <i>Insert Area [a]</i>
tool bar icon and then enter the correct X,Y, Z coordinate information into the
Edit Audience Area Properties sheet.</p>
<p>The scanning routine also has difficulty plotting simulations on
4-sided areas that have one very short side. So, don't try to beat the pro-gram
by turning a triangular area into a 4-sided one by putting in a fourth point.
It won't work.</p>
<p><b>Adding Listener Seats</b></p>
<p>Listener Seats provide a convenient reference point for many EASE,
EARS and AURA simulations. They represent identifiable points for in-depth
acoustic investigations. They also represent good spots (seats) to sit in and
look around the Room using the graphic capabilities of EASE.</p>
<p>Listener Seats are easy to add. Pick an Audience Area at the
spot you would like to place a Listener Seat. Then right click to bring up the
Mouse menu and select <i>Seat On Area</i>. This will bring up a Properties
sheet for the Listener Seat; fill in the coordinate information and click on <i>OK</i>
and the Listeners Seat is added to the room model. Try it; it's simple to do.</p>
<p>You can also add Listener Seats with the <i>Insert Listener Seat
[c]</i> tool. Simply click on the <i>Insert Listener Seat</i> icon in the tool
bar and then on the spot where you want to place the Listener Seat.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>You can even draw in rows of seats if you want. Instead of
picking Seat on Area in the Mouse menu, choose <i>Insert Seat Grid</i>. This
will bring up two prompts; the first asking for Seat Distance X and the second
for Seat Distance Y. X is the distance between seats and Y is the distance
between rows. Using 3 for X and 4 for Y will produce the graphic shown below.
Notice that the seats are placed on the floor and not on the Audience Area.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=340
src="E1.files/image087.jpg"></p>
<p>If you feel the graphic is cluttered by all the seats, you can
turn off their display using the Switch Listener Seat On/Off icon in the tool
bar section or delete them by using the Undo command. A way to delete most of
them or another way to delete all of them is to use the <i>Show</i> <i>Listener
Seat Table </i>icon. This will open a table listing all the Listener Seats;
select the ones you want to delete and then under the<i> Edit </i>pull<i> </i>down
menu choose <i>Delete.</i></p>
<p><b>Closing a Room</b></p>
<p><img width=251 height=294
src="E1.files/image088.jpg"></p>
<p>We constructed our room in the Room Open modeling mode to speed
up the modeling process. Since the Room is now complete we need to “Close the
Room”. EASE can not run any simulations that require RT figures, such as the D/R
Ratio until the Room is closed.</p>
<p>Right click on the screen background to open the Mouse menu and
select <i>Room Data </i>to open the Edit Room Data window. Select the<i> Data </i>tab,
if it<i> </i>isn't already open, and click on the <i>Room Open</i> box to erase
the check mark.</p>
<p>Then click on <i>Apply</i> and <i>Recompute</i>. <i>Apply</i>
will “Close the Room” if there are no holes in it or any other problems. <i>Recompute</i>
tells the program to calculate the Room's volume, average absorption
coefficient and reverb times. Note that the program has now calculated the Room
Volume at 67,424.99 Cubic Feet.</p>
<p>If there are holes in the Room or other problems, an error
message will ap-pear giving you information on the nature of the problem.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Reverb Times</b></p>
<p>To see a tabular listing of the Reverb times, click on the Room
RT tab. Note that EASE has calculated RT60 times at 1/3 octave intervals from
100 Hz to 10,000 Hz using Eyring's formula. To see if Sabine's formula produces
similar results, change Eyring to Sabine and click on the Recompute button.</p>
<p><img width=236 height=277
src="E1.files/image089.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that there are small differences between the calculations
made with Sabine and Eyring formulas. Both of these formulas are generalized
formulas, meaning that they are not perfect in all applications. Sabine is
considered to be more accurate in larger rooms with homogenous distribution of
the absorbing materials while Eyring yields better results in smaller rooms
having a wider variety of surface materials.</p>
<p>You probably also noticed that under the drop down menu you used
to toggle be-tween Eyring and Sabine there is a check box for <i>RT Locked</i>
selection. This option allow you to enter measured RT data into the program and
Lock it into place. The measured RT data will then be used for all calculations
using RT times, instead of the data based on the wall material information and
the room volume and surface area. Measured RT data is recommended, whenever
measured data is available.</p>
<p>The File Folder and Floppy Disk Icons below the Lock check box
allow you to Save and Reload (Import) different RT curves.</p>
<p>The drop down menu RT tab also includes fields for Temperature,
Humidity and Air Pressure. These all have an effect on the calculations, so
don't ignore them.</p>
<p>EASE users can also use the Ray Tracing module to generate RT
times calculated using the Schroeder Back Integration method and then insert
them into the program. The Schroeder method is generally considered more
accurate than either Eyring or Sabine. The preferred method, however, is
measured data whenever it is available.</p>
<p>If you would like to see a graph of the RT Times, close the Edit
Room Data window to return to the Main menu and select <i>Room Info/Draw</i> <i>RT
</i>from the<i> View </i>pull down menu. Graphs created with both formulas are
shown below.</p>
<p><img width=628 height=331
src="E1.files/image090.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that even though the projected RT60 times are somewhat
different, both show a definite boominess at the low end. To see how much the
reverberation changes when the room is filled with an audience, change the
seating area material from MTSEATWD to PUBINWDT and then go back to the RT60
graph. As you can see, the room quiets down considerably when an audience is
present.</p>

<p><b>Finding and Fixing Holes</b></p>
<p>If you made no mistakes in building the Model_1 Room, It closed
without any problems. On the other hand, if you made a mistake some-where your
Room probably has a ‘Hole” in it.</p>
<p>The first indication that you have one or more Holes in your
model usually comes after you have Closed the Room and attempt to check data or
exit the Edit Project module. It usually takes the form of the Error message
shown below.</p>
<p><img width=260 height=113
src="E1.files/image091.jpg"></p>
<p>Holes are the result of violating one or more of the EASE
modeling rules. They are a sign that something isn't quite right and has to be
fixed before you can go on.</p>
<p>Finding Holes in a Room can be an exasperating experience until
you are familiar with the techniques involved. Eliminating Holes involved a
systematic search for the offending Face(s) or Vertices, determining the
problem(s) and then eliminating it(them).</p>
<p>EASE 4.3 will find most, if not all, of these problems for you
and then on command fix most of them for you. Even though EASE 4.3 will find
and fix most of these problems for you, it's important that you be aware of the
types of modeling errors that cause Holes. An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure.</p>
<p><b>Stacked Vertices </b>are one common problem. Stacked
Vertices is the term used to describe having 2 or more Vertices with the same
coor-dinate location. They are easy to create when the Duplicate command is
used to add Vertices. This leads to adjoining Faces having differ-ent Vertices
instead of common ones.</p>
<p>Stacked Vertices can be eliminated by a simple key stroke
command, Crtl + F12 which seeks them out and eliminates them. In fact, many
experienced users automatically hit Ctrl + F12 before they Close a room to
short circuit this problem. Try it. You can't lose.</p>
<p><b>Inverted Faces; </b>Faces whose reflective surface
is not facing into the room, are another common problem. The best way to
prevent them<b> </b>is to check their orientation as they are being created and
Invert them if they were inserted improperly.</p>
<p><b>Missing Faces </b>are another problem. It's easy
to miss inserting a Face or to inadvertently delete a Face, especially when you
are working<b> </b>late at night and tired.</p>
<p><b>Stacked Faces </b>are another possibility. This
term describes multiple Faces stacked on top of each other. It's easy to do
this when the Du-plicate command is used to create Faces.</p>
<p>The way to identify Missing Faces and Stacked Faces is to click
repeatedly in the offending area to verify that a Face was put in and that
extra Faces do not exist. The solution, of course, is to add any missing Faces
and delete any stacked Faces.</p>
<p>Missing or Stacked Faces can also bring up a <i>Non Zero Surface
Integral Error</i> message. Treat this Error message just as you would the Hole
in Room error message.</p>
<p><b>Two-Fold Face Errors</b>: Holes are also caused by
mistakenly using Two-Fold Faces where regular Faces should be used. This can
happen<b> </b>quite easily, if as you are building the model you put in a
Two-Fold Face as a seating area and then build the walls. The Property sheet
for the walls will open as a Two Fold Face and remain that way until you change
it back to being a regular Face. The color of these Faces when you select them
is your clue to this problem. Their border will be either white or yellow if
they are a regular Face and blue or orange if they are a Two-Fold Face.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Another common problem is forgetting to include all associated
Vertices into a Face. Remember, when we put in the walls for our Tutorial 1
building, we had to include in the wall Faces all the Vertices associated with
the steps. It is a must. If you followed the Tutorial and made sure the
Highlight Vertices of Picked Face was selected (see page 51), it should be easy
for you spot any mistakes by selecting the Faces and checking the Vertices.
Another way is to open the Properties sheet for the offending Face and compare
the Vertice listing to what should be listed. This can usually be easily done
by just counting the number of Vertices. If the Face should have 8 Vertices and
the listing shows only 6, you have found the problem. The solution, of course,
is to delete the Face and re-enter it, being careful to include all 8 Ver-tices
in the Face.</p>
<p>Reflectors or acoustical panels flown in the room must be Two
Fold Faces and must not touch the face of any of the surfaces. If they touch,
you have a hole. The obvious solution is to move them a fraction of an inch
away from the surface, so they don't actually touch it. Reflectors and
acoustical panels that are mounted on a surface must be Two Fold Faces that are
Coated onto the surface Face.</p>
<p>Now, lets go through the procedure for fixing Holes in EASE 4.3.
Open the Edit Project module, if it isn't already open and Invert one of the
side wall Faces. Now exit from the Edit Project program. This will bring up an
Apply Project Data prompt. Answering Yes will produce the Face Mismatch or Hole
in Room Error Message. Clicking on OK will introduce a Data Not Checked, Save
Anyway? prompt. Answering Yes will close the Edit Project module, answering No
will close the prompt and return you to the Edit Project window. Answer No.</p>
<p><img width=554 height=112
src="E1.files/image092.jpg"></p>
<p>Now select Check Holes under the Tool pull down menu. This will
bring up the following window.</p>
<p><img width=600 height=374
src="E1.files/image093.jpg"></p>
<p>The program has identified the problem areas for you and is
listing the offending Vertices and Edges. The list can be lengthy if there are
a number of holes. Selecting one of the listed Vertices will prompt the program
to identify the edge involved by turning it red. Sequentially clicking on the
listed Vertices will help you identify the offending Face.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Clicking on <i>Redraw Al</i>l will outline in red all the offending
Faces. This can be overwhelming if a number of Faces are incorrect, so use it
carefully. What it does do is show you the extent of the problem. Clicking on <i>Redraw
Edge</i> or in one of the Vertice listing boxes will return you to the single
Edge view. Notice that EASE will automatically center the offending Edge on the
screen for you, if you put a check in the <i>Center </i>box.</p>
<p><img width=595 height=371
src="E1.files/image094.jpg"></p>
<p>At this point, you can return to the Edit Project window just by
clicking on it and then take a closer look at one of the offending Faces. If
you see that it is turned around, use the <i>Invert</i> button to correct its
orientation and then return to the Check Holes window by clicking on it. If the
inverted Face was the only Hole, the Check Holes window will not open. Instead
you will receive a Well Done prompt.</p>
<p>If inverting the Face corrected the problem, but other Holes
still exist the Check Holes window will open. However, the Vertice listings
asso-ciated with the Hole you eliminated will have disappeared from the
listing.</p>
<p>You can use this technique to one by one eliminate all the Holes
in the model. The easier way is to let EASE do it for you. Notice that the
Close Holes section of the Check Holes window contains a listing of the
modeling errors that create Holes. Press the Close Holes button and EASE will fix
them for you.</p>
<p>The exception to this is missing Faces if your model has too
many of them. There is a limit to the miracles EASE can perform. Because of
this, it's wise to first let EASE fix the other modeling errors and then use
the <i>Redraw All</i> button to view the extent of the missing Faces problem
before using the Create Missing Faces command.</p>
<p><b>One other word of caution. </b>The Auto-Orientation
command will properly align all the Faces However, before using it make sure
that<b> </b>none of the Faces are selected. If a Face is selected, the program
will align all Faces with the one Picked. This doesn't represent a prob-lem if
the Picked Face is properly oriented. If it isn't, the program makes sure every
Face is improperly oriented and, in effect, turns the room inside out. The
program doesn't see this as a Hole and congratulates you on a job well done. At
the same time, however, it turns the room volume negative which interferes with
(prevents) many of the mapping simulations, such as ALCons. The solution to
this problem is to Invert one of the Faces so it is properly oriented, make
sure it is selected and then repeat Auto - Orientation.</p>
<p><b>Helpful Hint: </b><i>Shift + Ctrl + F12</i><b> </b>eliminates
all unattached Vertices. These don't cause a Hole problem, but can mess up your
drawing. They<b> </b>are often produced when a Face is deleted and the
associated Vertices are not. Many experienced users use the <i>Shift + Ctrl +
F12</i> key command to blow away unwanted Vertices whenever a Face is deleted.
It eliminates having to delete them one by one. Another technique is to use the
<i>Shift + Delete</i> key command to delete a Face. This command deletes both
the Face and the unattached Vertices.</p>

<p><b>Adding Loudspeakers</b></p>
<p>Now, it's time to add loudspeaker(s) to the Room. This means
that the 'burden of proof&quot; has now shifted to you, the designer. EASE does
not decide for you what loudspeaker should be used , how many will be needed,
or where they should be located. You, the designer have to make these decisions
based on your knowledge and experience. All EASE can do is tell you how well
your choices will work.</p>
<p>Select the Insert Loudspeaker [l] icon in the tool bars and then
click on a location. This will open the Loudspeaker Property screen shown
below.</p>
<p><img width=417 height=335
src="E1.files/image095.jpg"></p>
<p>First, let's position the loudspeaker. A good spot to hang the
loudspeaker would appear to be at the front of the Chancel (stage) right on the
cen-ter line of the room. EASE places loudspeakers by a reference point that
represents the point of rotation used during the Loudspeaker measure-ments, so
we can't hang the loudspeaker at 25 feet, the height of the peak. Let's use 22
feet in-stead. Use the cursor and tab keys to insert the correct coordinate
information (0, -20, 22).</p>
<p>Another way to insert loudspeakers is to more fully use the
graphical modeling capabilities of EASE. In this case, use <i>Shift + z</i> to
select the overhead view and open the Editing window. Set the <i>Plane Value</i>
at 22 feet. Then, use the <i>[l]</i> key command to open Insert Loudspeaker and
use the overhead view and grid to insert the loud-speaker on the room center
line at the front of the Chancel.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, let's select the loudspeaker we plan to use.</p>
<p>To choose the Loudspeaker, click in the white field under
Speaker Model or the . button next to it to open the Select Speaker window.
It will show only Sphere Sphere is the Default loudspeaker and not what we want
to use.</p>
<p>Use the <i>Browse</i> button to open Select Project Database and
select the Speaker Models tab. We want to use a Renkus-Heinz STX4/94, so browse
to the Renkus-Heinz/RHstx folder and select the STX4/94; then click on <i>Add</i>
and <i>Close</i>. While in the loudspeaker database, you may want to select and
add to the project file sev-eral other loudspeakers you would like to try. If
so, go ahead and do it. Note that we included a STX4/64 in our project
database.</p>
<p><img width=257 height=217
src="E1.files/image097.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, select the STX4/94 in the Choose Loudspeaker window and <i>OK</i>
the selec-tion. Then, hit <i>OK</i> to approve the insertion. You should now be
able to see a yellow horn shaped loudspeaker symbol above the front edge of the
stage and a wire-frame drawing of the STX4/94.</p>
<p>The spot identified as S1 at the base of the horn symbol is the
reference or rotation point for the loudspeaker. It's also the spot used to
Pick or select the loudspeaker. Zoom in on the loudspeaker if you have trouble
seeing the spot.</p>
<p>Note: If you can not see the wireframe drawing, it either is
turned Off in the Options folder or the database does not include a wireframe
drawing for the loudspeaker you chose. If you still have the Vertex labels
turned On, they may be cluttering the screen. Turn them off using the Show
Vertex Labels icon. You may also want to turn off the Grid. If you do, right
click on the screen, select Grids from the Mouse menu and turn off (uncheck)
the Z grid.</p>
<p><img width=218 height=254
src="E1.files/image098.jpg"></p>
<p>The loudspeaker symbol may be larger than you think it should
be. To change the size of the symbol, right click on the screen and then choose
<i>Room Data</i> from the Mouse menu. Select the <i>Settings</i> tab to bring
up the Loudspeaker Symbol dialog box.</p>
<p>Reduce the size (Width and Depth) of the loudspeaker symbol by
reducing the fig-ures in the white Loudspeaker Symbol fields, then click <i>Apply</i>
and <i>OK</i>. The <i>Apply</i> button gives you the opportunity to view the
result of the change before actually mak-ing it.</p>
<p>Now go to the Options window using the <i>F9</i> key command or
by clicking on the Op-tions button in the tool bar and then open the Items
folder. Notice the three radio but-tons (round check boxes). These allow you to
choose how you want the loudspeakers displayed on the screen. Try them out by
selecting them one by one and observing the changes on the screen after you hit
<i>Apply</i>.</p>
<p><img width=280 height=234
src="E1.files/image099.jpg"></p>
<p>Start by turning off the <i>Show Loudspeaker Symbols</i> and
checking the <i>Show</i> <i>Loudspeaker Cases </i>box. Then hit<i> Apply </i>to
add a wireframe drawing of the<i> </i>loudspeaker. (Note: This assumes you are
using a loudspeaker whose manu-facture has supplied wireframe drawings along
with his data.) The loud-speaker symbol will still show as it was Picked when
you started this exercise. However, as soon as you select another item, the
symbol will disappear. Now, to Pick the Loudspeaker you must click on one of
its Edges.</p>
<p>Next, make sure the <i>Show dB Coverage Cones</i> box is checked
and then put a check in the <i>3 dB Cov. Cone</i> box and click on <i>OK</i>.
These setups act as the master control for the dB Coverage Cones we'll be using
to aim the Loud-speaker and have precedence over any setups made in the
Loudspeaker Properties sheets. If the cones are turned Off here, they can't be
turned On in the Properties window.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Aiming Loudspeakers</b></p>
<p>Now, go to the Loudspeaker Property sheet (select the
loudspeaker and use the right mouse key to open the Mouse menu and then select
Properties). Put a check in the Show dB Cov. Cone box and OK the change. You
should now be able to see the coverage cone on the screen. The purple line
represents the coverage axis. The red lines outline the minus 3 dB coverage
cone. As you can see, EASE aimed the loudspeaker right down the Y axis and
straight ahead.</p>
<p>Note that you can also turn the dB Coverage Cone On or Off by
using the Show dB Cov. Cone option available in the Mouse menu.</p>
<p>We'll use the Loudspeaker Aiming option available in the Mouse
menu to re-aim the loudspeaker. Select the loudspeaker and then hit the right
mouse button to open the Mouse menu and choose Loud-speaker Aiming from the pop
up Mouse menu. This will open the window shown below. You are ac-tually looking
through the loud-speaker at its view of the room. The red line represents the
-3 dB down points, the yellow the - 6 dB down points and the green - 9 dB down.
As you can see they follow the loudspeaker's directivity pat-tern.</p>
<p><img width=486 height=304
src="E1.files/image100.jpg"></p>
<p>To re-aim the loudspeaker, all you need to do is click on the
spot where you feel the loudspeaker should be aimed. Notice that you can not
put the aiming point off to one side of the room. As long as the program is in
the Symmetrical mode, a loudspeaker positioned in the symmetry plane can only
be aimed down the Y axis. Everything wouldn't be symmetrical if the
loud-speaker was turned to the right or left or rotated. All you can do it
point it up or down, which in our tu-torial room is all we need to do.</p>
<p><img width=488 height=305
src="E1.files/image101.jpg"></p>
<p>If we wanted to get around this, there are two ways to do it.
One is to go out of the Symmetrical mode.</p>
<p><b>The point to remember about this is that once you leave the Symmetrical
mode, it's not a good idea to try to return to it.</b></p>
<p>It's possible, but not recommended. Too many strange things can
happen in the process. The other way is to move the loudspeaker a few inches
off the center line. This will introduce a second mirror image loudspeaker.
But, you can ignore it during the simulations by simply not turning it on.</p>

<p><b>Mapping</b></p>
<p>Although there are several ways to aim loudspeakers, most users
use Loudspeaker Aiming to quickly aim the loudspeaker(s) because it's so quick
and easy to use and then they fine tune the aiming while evaluating the
system's performance in Area Mapping. We'll go into the other loudspeaker
aiming methods when we cover Advanced Room Investigations later in this
tutorial.</p>
<p>The Area Mapping module is usually used for the fine tuning.
There are two ways to open the Area Mapping module. One is to return to the
Main Menu and select <i>Area Mapping</i> from the Calculations pull down menu.
The other is to use the <i>Ctrl + Alt + a</i> key command. Either way will open
the mapping window shown below. The two Areas shown are the Audience Areas we
put in several steps back.</p>
<p><img width=635 height=460

<p>The bottom row of tool bar icons (see copy below), except for
the four on the far right, are shortcuts to the wide range of simulations
avail-able. The four on the far right control how the results are presented.
We'll check them out later.</p>
<p><img width=679 height=56

<p>We are mainly interested in looking at the direct sound level in
the Audience Areas at this point, so click on the Direct SPL icon in the

<p>This window and the ones that follow remind you of the
parameters that need to be set up before the simulation. The Settings tab is
where you select the frequency of the simulation, choose what loudspeaker(s)
will be used and decide upon the resolution (in feet or meters for patches and
in dB for Isoline maps). You also are presented with the choice of running a <i>Single</i>
map or of using the <i>All</i> <i>Mappings </i>feature.</p>
<p><img width=216 height=216

frequency. This is a great time saver when you are doing a detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Let’s use All Mappings and accept the default Resolution. All
Mappings takes only a few seconds longer and it gives so much more information.
All we need to do is to click on the Loudspeaker button and then turn the
loudspeaker <i>On</i>. Then click on<i> Next </i>to go to the second setup page<i>
</i>(Items).</p>
<p><img width=216 height=219
src="E1.files/image105.jpg"></p>
<p>The Items window lets you choose what Audience Areas and
Listener Seats will be included in the simulation.</p>
<p>Next, click on the <i>Aud. Are</i>a button and make sure both
Audience Areas are turned On. Then either open the Cal-culation tab or click on
<i>Next</i> to open the third setup page.</p>
<p>The Noise setup window which allows you to set the noise levels
that will be used in intelligibility calculations. Accept the default setting
for now.</p>
<p><img width=216 height=219
src="E1.files/image106.jpg"></p>
<p>The Calculations window adds further parameters to the
simulation. Here is where Shadowing can be turned On or Off. When Shadowing is
On, EASE take into account the shadowing effect of any objects in the room,
such as columns and balconies. When it's Off, it doesn't.</p>
<p>Under Interference, make sure Interference Sum and Third Octave
are checked. For now, leave the default set-ting for Split Time set at its
default setting.</p>
<p>All these options will be covered in detail later on in the Room
Investigation section of this tutorial. At the moment we are only interested in
aiming the loudspeaker.</p>
<p><img width=216 height=216
src="E1.files/image107.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, click on <i>OK</i> to run the simulation.</p>

<p>As soon as the simulation is complete, the screen shown below
will appear. We'll cover it features and functions in detail under Room
In-vestigations later on. For now, either minimize it or shrink it by clicking
on the <i>[–]</i> icon in the upper left corner.</p>
<p><img width=533 height=386

<p>Notice that the color patches are quite large. This is a sign
the resolution we used was to coarse. Return to the Mapping Setup window by
clicking on the <i>Recalculate icon [!]</i> at the far left of the lower tool
bar and change the <i>Patch Size</i> to 1. Then, rerun the simulation. The
reso-lution will be much improved.</p>
<p>Our original coverage map also showed that the loudspeaker
needed to be reaimed. So, lets re-aim the loud-speaker. Return to the Edit
Project win-dow and select the loudspeaker, then right click and select <i>Loudspeaker
Aim-ing. </i>Re-aim the loudspeaker and then<i> </i>click on <i>F6</i> to apply
(send) the changes to the main module. Return to the Area Mapping window and
select <i>Acquire</i> <i>Project Data </i>under the<i> File </i>pull down<i> </i>menu
or use the <i>Ctrl + o</i> key command to update the Area Mapping module. Then
rerun the simulation. If you are happy with the results fine, If you are not
reaim the loudspeaker again and/or select a different loudspeaker and rerun the
simulation again. It only takes a few seconds.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=339
src="E1.files/image110.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that if you had returned to the Main window and selected
Area Map-ping for a second time you would have opened the area mapping module
again and been able to run a second map based on the new loudspeaker aiming.
This would allow you to com-pare the two maps side by side.</p>
<p><img width=472 height=342
src="E1.files/image111.jpg"></p>
<p>You can also quickly reaim, reposition or change loudspeaker
models using the Loudspeaker Properties folder.</p>
<p>Select the loudspeaker, then right click and select Properties
from the Mouse menu. Make the changes and then hit <i>Apply</i> to observe the
effect of the changes in the loudspeaker cover-age cone. If they look good, run
an-other map to see the results.</p>
<p>When they are satisfied with the direct sound coverage, many
users then use the intelligibility maps to do the final fine tuning. Just click
on the STI icon in the tool bar section and <i>OK</i> the setup windows as they
appear.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes right now to become familiar with this
portion of the program. Try moving the loudspeaker backwards and forward, then
up and down and observe the results. Try different loudspeakers to see what
effect this has. You'll have fun.</p>

<p><b>Adding / Changing Face Colors</b></p>
<p>Now its time to take a closer look at the room we have created
and the colors you selected during the modeling. Activate the Main window, open
the <i>View</i> pull down menu and select <i>Standard Rendering</i>. When the
Eyes screen appears, open the <i>Dye</i> pull down menu and choose <i>Face

<p>You will notice that the green Audience Areas detract from the
view. Go to the <i>Item</i> pull down menu and turn off the Audience Areas
(just click on <i>Audience Area</i>).</p>
<p>If you want to use the Walker, just click on the <i>Walker</i> icon
to open its control screen. Then take a stroll around the room. (If you forgot
how to use the Walker, refer to Using the Walker on page 34.)</p>

<p>If you don't like the colors you originally chose or if you
didn't bother to add them when you were building the room, it's easy to add or
change them.</p>
<p><img width=462 height=342
src="E1.files/image114.jpg"></p>
<p>Return to the Edit Project Data window, Pick a Face and then use
the Ctrl + F2 key command to open the color assign-ment window for that Face.
Another way is to use the right mouse button to open the Mouse menu. Then
select Color from the pop up menu that ap-pears to open the color assignment
win-dow. Of course, you could also open the Face’s Properties folder and click
on the color bar.</p>
<p>If you see the color you want in one of the Basic Color boxes
click on it and then hit <i>OK</i>. It's that simple.</p>
<p>If you don't see the color you want, clicking on the color
closest to it will take you to that color in the color bar section. Then use
the cursor and/or the vertical color bar to find the exact color you want.
After you have made your se-lection, click on <i>Add to Custom Colors.</i> Then
click on the Custom Color you just created and on <i>OK</i></p>
<p><img width=464 height=348
src="E1.files/image115.jpg"></p>
<p>You can now assign this custom color to any Face by selecting
the Face and then reopening the color assignment window using <i>Ctrl + F2</i>
or the Mouse Menu.</p>
<p>An easy way to change the color of a number of Faces is to use
the Face Table. Use the <i>Show Face Table</i> Icon in the Tool Bars to open
the Face Table. Note that any colors you have assigned to Faces are shown in
the Color col-umn. Faces which do not have an as-signed color show only a number
in the Color column.</p>
<p>Go to the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and turn on <i>Color and
Material Coupled</i>. Then select the color you want to change by clicking on
it in the Color col-umn. This will open the Color Assign-ment window. Select
the new color and click on <i>OK</i>. This will change all the Faces having
that Material to the new color. It's easy.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>In Constructing a Model we covered the construction of a basic
room model in EASE using the x,y,z coordinate method. In this section, we will
become acquainted with the wide array of modeling tools offered by EASE 4.3.and
explore the use of Create Shapes and prototypes to reduce the amount of
modeling time required.</p>
<p>Certain complex shapes, curved surfaces in particular, can be
both difficult and time consuming to enter with the techniques we learned while
constructing our Model_1 Tutorial room. Other modeling tasks, such as adding
row upon row of bleachers or installing a distributed loudspeaker system in the
ceiling of a room can be very time consuming without using shortcuts. There
also will be times when it would be nice to be able to cut a Face into two or three
parts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, EASE includes a number of tools that make these
tasks a snap. Please take the time to at least scan this section of the
Tuto-rial to get a feeling for how these tasks can be handled. Knowing that
these tools are available could save you hours on your next model-ing job.</p>
<p><b>Adding Windows and Doors</b></p>
<p>We did not include windows or doors in our Model_1 room. Now.
let’s add windows to dress up our model.</p>
<p>As the first step, open the Model_1 room and do a <i>Save
Project As</i> to create a new project. It’s always a good practice to save the
original project before doing any major modifications. We’ll call it Model_2.
Note that the Save File dialog box directs the new file to the Tutorial folder.</p>
<p><img width=248 height=183
src="E1.files/image117.jpg"></p>
<p>We’ll use the Coat and Duplicate/Displace features to add three
4-foot by 6-foot windows to the side walls for practice. We'll put them on 14
foot centers starting 10 feet from the rear wall and place them 3 feet up from
the floor.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do create the window Face, the two
most popular are using Duplicate/Displace and with Extrude. We'll go through
the Duplicate/Displace method first.</p>
<p><img width=313 height=215
src="E1.files/image118.jpg"></p>
<p>The coordinates for the first Vertex will be -25, -65, 3 and
that is all the Vertex info we need to know to create the window's other 3
Vertices using Duplicate/Displace. Select the <i>Insert Vertex [v]</i> tool and
then click on the screen to add the Vertex. Then enter the coordinate
information into the pop up screen to properly locate the Vertex.</p>
<p>Next, right click on the screen to open the Mouse menu and
select <i>Dupli-cate </i>to bring up the Displacement screen; type 4 into the<i>
y-value </i>field to<i> </i>locate the other lower corner of the window and <i>OK</i>
the move. Next, use <i>Duplicate </i>to create the top corners of the window
(hint: displace the z lo-cation by 6). The next step is to add the Face. Click
on the <i>Add Face</i> <i>tool [f] </i>and then on the window's Vertices to
make the Face.</p>
<p>When the Properties folder opens, use <i>WindGlass</i> for the
material. Then use the Coat feature to Coat the window onto the wall (don't
for-get to make it a Two-Fold Face). Note that if you don't know the Face
number of the wall, you will need to return to the Edit Project window to get
it. You can't Coat a Face onto another Face unless you know its Face number.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The Extrude method is even simpler. Insert the first Vertex.
Then right click and select <i>Extrude</i>. Put a 4 in the y axis field and a 6
in the z axis field. Click on <i>OK</i> and EASE will make the Face for you.</p>
<p>We'll use Duplicate/Displace to create the other Faces. Select
the Face and enter 14 in the y axis field. Then put a 2 in the <i>Repeated</i>
field.</p>
<p>Click on <i>OK</i> and it's done. It is that easy.</p>
<p><img width=659 height=265
src="E1.files/image119.jpg"></p>
<p>A word of caution about using <i>Coat Of</i> to paste one Face
on top of another. EASE automatically moves the Face being coated onto an-other
Face a small distance away from the other Face. By coating our first window
onto the wall that faces into the room (by placing the first Vertex on the
reflective wall, Face F6 in the model)l), we made sure the window would be
placed inside the Room. If we had placed the first Vertex on the outside of the
wall (Face F6* in the model), the program would have placed the window outside
the room.</p>
<p><b>Using Edges &amp; Vertex On Face Margin</b></p>
<p>Edges (lines drawn between two Vertices) only serve to add
detail to a model for cosmetic purposes. They are not considered in any
calcu-lations.</p>
<p>As an example of their use, lets use Edges to add four panes to
the windows in our model. The first step will be to insert Vertices into the
Margins (edges) of one of the existing windows.</p>
<p>Hint, you may want to Zoom In on the window to better observe
the procedure.</p>
<p><img width=242 height=167
src="E1.files/image120.jpg"></p>
<p>We’ll use the <i>Vertex On Face Margin</i> command to do this.
Select one of the windows, open the Mouse Menu and select Vertex On Face
Margin. Then click on one of the edges of the window, let’s say the bottom
edge. The program will insert the Vertex into the edge of the window at the
point you clicked. Now all you need to do is to make sure it is in the right
position.</p>
<p>Select the Vertice and right click on it to open its Properties
window. You’ll find that the only coordinate you need to change is the y
coordinate. Correct it and then hit <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>If you were to open the Window’s Properties folder now, you
would see that the new Vertice has been added to the listing of the window’s
Vertices. It is now part of the</p>
<p>window. Repeat the procedure to add a Vertice to the top of the
window, Then click on the <i>Insert Edge [e]</i> tool and connect the two
Vertices together. Repeat the procedure to put Vertices into the sides of the
window and create an Edge between them.</p>
<p>If you have trouble selecting the new Vertice after it is
inserted, use the Find <i>[Ctrl F]</i> command to select it.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Finding Unknown Coordinate Locations</b></p>
<p>While modeling a Room, it is not unusual to encounter situations
where an exact dimension is required, but not shown on the blueprints and the
approximate figure provided by scaling is not good enough for EASE. EASE
demands that Faces be flat (planar) and that Faces meet perfectly! It doesn't
like holes!</p>
<p>Situations like this often occur in the Chancel area of churches
when a section of the rear wall is brought forward to provide an exit into the
Sacristy. See drawing below.</p>
<p><b>Z Dimension Unknown</b></p>
<p><img width=482 height=323
src="E1.files/image121.jpg"></p>
<p>0, 0, 25</p>
 <p>22,</p>
 <p>-24, 0</p>
 <p>-25, 0, 12</p>
 <p>2, -24,</p>
 <p>0</p>
<p>-2, -24, 0</p>
<p>-25, 0, 2</p>
<p><img width=7 height=7
src="E1.files/image122.jpg"> -22, -24, 0</p>
<p>-25, -20, 0</p>
<p>The problem is the z coordinate dimension for the Vertices that
mark the intersection of the walls with the roof. The x and y coordinate
fig-ures at the floor level are usually either given or are easy to measure and
they are the same for the upper Vertices. The z dimension is the one that quite
often is an unknown! Fortunately, EASE can help find this dimension. It’s done
using the ability of EASE to Extrude Vertices and Edges.</p>
<p>The first step is to insert one of the four corner Vertices into
the floor of the Chancel. Assuming the section being added is 4 feet deep and
10 feet across, the x, y, z Coordinates for the floor Vertices would be -5, 0,
2 &amp; -5, -4, 2 and 5, 0, 2 &amp; 5, -4, 2. First, <i>Pick</i> the Chancel
floor Face (F5) and then right click to bring up the Mouse menu. Notice that
there are two commands that deal with Vertices, <i>Vertex On</i> <i>Face Margin
</i>and<i> Vertex On Face</i>. The<i> Vertex On Face Margin </i>will insert a
Vertice into the Edge of a Face while the<i> Vertex On Face </i>places<i> </i>the
Vertex within the Face.</p>
<p>We'll use the Vertex on Face Margin to add the Vertice at -5, 0,
2 and let EASE put in its mirror image Vertice at 5, 0, 2. Select <i>Vertex On</i>
<i>Face Margin </i>and use your Mouse to place the Vertice at approximately its
correct location on the edge of F5. Left click at that location to<i> </i>add
the Vertice. EASE will put in its mirror image. Pick one of the two Vertices
that were added, then right click on it to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Properties</i>.
Change the x coordinate to -5 and hit <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Now, <i>Pick</i> the Chancel floor, Face F5 and open its
Properties sheet. Note that the new Vertices have been added to the Face's
descrip-tion. Next check the rear wall, Face F8, in the same fashion. You will
find the new Vertices have also been automatically added to this Face.</p>
<p>We’ll use the <i>Vertex On Face</i> command to insert the floor
Vertices at -5, -4, 2 and 5, -4, 2. Pick Face F5, and right click to open the
Mouse menu and select <i>Vertex on Face</i> from the Mouse menu. Next, left
click on Face 5 to add the Vertice and enter the correct coordi-nate
information when the Properties sheet opens.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that we didn't actually have to use the <i>Vertex on Face
Margin</i> and <i>Vertex On Face</i> commands. We could have just inserted one
of the floor Vertices at its proper coordinate location and then proceeded on
to the next step. It was good practice, though.</p>
<p>The next step is to Extrude one of the floor Vertices from the
floor to the ceiling Face. Select one of the Vertices, right click to open the
Mouse menu and then select <i>Extrude</i> to open the Extrude window shown on
the left below. Note that you'll have to click on the <i>Options</i> button to
open the Options portion of the window.</p>
<p><img width=173 height=190
src="E1.files/image123.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=177 height=291
src="E1.files/image124.jpg"></p>
<p>Insert 1 in the z field and check <i>Create Edge and Extrude to
Next Face</i> and click <i>OK</i>. This will extrude the Vertex to the Ceiling
Face and insert an Edge at the same time. See below.</p>
<p><img width=511 height=312
src="E1.files/image125.jpg"></p>
<p>In this situation we didn’t have to insert a positive figure in
the z field to tell the program what direction to Extrude to the next Face.
There will be cases, though, where it will be necessary to tell the program
what direction to Extrude and we wanted to acquaint you with the pos-sibility.</p>
<p>If you want to verify that the top Vertices were placed at the
proper height, switch to the end view. You will see that they are.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Now all we need to do is Extrude one of the Edges we just
created 4 feet in the y direction and we'll have two of the three Faces we need
in place. See below.</p>
<p><img width=507 height=308
src="E1.files/image126.jpg"></p>
<p>We could stop here, since you now know how to put in Vertices,
Edges and Faces when one of the coordinates is unknown. As it turns out, you
didn't need to know the unknown coordinate's exact location. However, let's continue
the room modification to gain experience in modifying rooms.</p>
<p>We'll start by adding the third Face (the front Face) to the
section we are building. The first step is to add the Vertex where the new
section meets the apex of the roof. Pick the Vertex at the end of the building
and use Duplicate/Displace to put in the new Vertex (Displace it -4 feet in the
y direction). Now adding the third Face is as simple as connecting the five
Vertices that define this Face. Use the <i>Insert Face</i> Icon or the <i>f</i>
key command and insert the Face.</p>
<p>All that remains is to get rid of the surface areas that are no
longer part of the Room. To do this, we’ll need to delete the chancel floor,
the roof and the two back wall Faces and replace them with new Faces. Pick them
and hit the <i>Delete</i> key. Then use the <i>Insert Face [f]</i> tool to put
in the new Faces. In the process of adding the rear wall Faces you’ll discover
that you need to add two new Vertices. See drawing on the next page. The best
way to do this is to use the <i>Vertex On Face Margin</i> command. Otherwise,
you’ll have to eventually blow away (delete) the two side wall Faces and redraw
them to include the new Vertices.</p>
<p>Helpful Hints</p>
<p>1. Don’t be afraid to make a mistake. If you do, you
always have the <i>Undo</i> command to fix it by stepping back to just before
you made the mistake.</p>
<p>2. You may want to delete and replace the Faces one by
one, instead of deleting all of them at once and then starting to redraw them.
If you delete too much of a model at one time, it’s easy to lose track of which
Vertice is which.</p>
<p>3. Before you start to enter a new Face, make sure you
have a clear view of all the Vertices that will go into the Face so it will be
easy to pick them. Use the scroll bars to turn and rotate the drawing and your
Mouse wheel to Zoom in and out until you get a clear view.</p>
<p>When you are finished adding the new Faces, you'll notice that
you have a Vertice left over, the one that used to be at the end of the roof
peak. Blow it away by selecting it and then hitting the <i>Delete</i> key.</p>
<p>Note that if you had been building this model from scratch
instead of modifying an existing model you would have had to create Ceiling
Faces before you could Extrude the floor Vertice to the ceiling. To do this you
would have had to insert a vertice at the end of the roof peak. When done, your
Room should look like the one shown on the next page.</p>

<p>New Vertices</p>
<p><b>Distance Calculations</b></p>
<p>From time to time, you will want to know the exact distance
between two points in the room; for example, between the loudspeaker and a
listener at the rear of the room. EASE can do it for you.</p>
<p>Put in a <i>Listener Seat</i> at the rear of the room if your
model doesn’t already have one. Start by clicking on one of the Audience Areas
at the very rear of the area. Then use the Mouse menu to place a <i>Seat on
Area.</i></p>
<p>Next, Pick the Loudspeaker, then right click on it to bring up
the Mouse menu and select <i>Keep For Distance [Shift + k)</i>. Then <i>Pick</i>
one of the <i>Listener Seats</i>, right click for the Mouse menu and select <i>Show
Distance [Shift + 0 (zero)]</i>. This will introduce a pop up screen showing
the angular relationship between the two points, the physical distance between
them (the distance between the Loudspeaker and the Lis-tener Seat) and the time
needed for sound waves to cover the distance.</p>
<p>Note that as long as <i>Keep For Distance</i> is selected on the
Loudspeaker, you can also easily check the distance between the Loudspeaker and
any point in the room just by clicking on the desired point and then using <i>Shift
+ 0 (zero</i>).</p>

<p><b>Create Shape Examples</b></p>
<p>The Create Shape 3D, Line Array and Circular Array sections of
the Insert pull down menu can be used effectively to create complex shapes with
a minimum of effort. Create Shape is also used to place columns and other
objects inside the room.</p>
<p>Lets create a new name for this model. We'll call it <i>Circus</i>.
Open EASE and choose <i>New Projec</i>t under the File menu (or use the desktop
Icon to Start Working and Create Project) and enter the name Tutorial in the <i>Hall</i>
field and Circus in the <i>Project File Name</i> field. We want to place the
Circus files in the Tutorial folder. Approve the setup by clicking on <i>Create</i>
and then go to <i>Room Info/Data</i> under the <i>View</i> pull down menu and
enter Circus in the <i>Project Version</i> field. Then click on OK and the <i>Edit
Project</i> module will open automatically.</p>
<p><img width=345 height=273
src="E1.files/image129.jpg"></p>
<p>For the first exercise, let’s create a room similar to the
Model_1 room we built in Section 3 of this Tutorial. We'll do this by first
making a box and then adding a roof to it. Select <i>Create Shape 3D</i> from
the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and then choose <i>Cuboid</i> (sometimes
called a shoebox) from the drop down listing at the top of the Create Shape
window.</p>
<p>Notice that you can choose between a Cuboid, Pyra-mid, Cupola,
Cylinder and Cone. We’ll practice with all of these before we finish this
section of the Tutorial.</p>
<p>We want to make a room 75' long, 50' wide and 12' high (not
including the roof). Notice that we inserted No into the <i>With Ceiling</i>
box field. We don't want to put in a ceiling, because we will be adding the
roof (ceiling) as the next step in building the room.</p>
<p>The <i>Hollow Polyhedron</i> box determines the orientation of
the Faces. When checked, it places all the reflective surfaces (the Faces)
facing into the room which is what we want. Clicking <i>OK</i> will generate
the room below.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E1.files/image130.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that the program put the 0, 0, 0 point in the center of
the room instead of at one end. We could have put this point at one end by
changing the <i>Center (Ft.) y</i> location from 0 to -37.5 in the Create Shape
dialog box. (Convention suggests that the y= 0 point should be at the front
wall of the room or the front of the stage, with the room extending in the
negative y direction.) The reason for this is that EASE, by default, aims the
loudspeakers in the negative y direction.</p>
<p>84</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>If we want to change the 0, 0, 0 location at this time, we can
easily do so by going to the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and selecting <i>Move
Room Origin.</i> Move Room Origin opens a screen that allows you to chance the
0, 0, 0 coordinate locations. Try it out; insert -37.5 in the y field and <i>OK</i>
the change.</p>
<p><img width=178 height=196
src="E1.files/image131.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that Move Room Origin moves the Room and not the point of
origin. That’s why we used -37.5 instead of 37.5. Remember this point as it
will come up again as we move through the Tutorial.</p>
<p>We also could have created this cuboid by inserting a single
Vertex into the drawing and then ex-truding it the proper distances along the
x, y and z axis. In EASE, there usually is more than one way to quickly and
easily accomplish an objective. The choice of which method to use often hinges
upon personal preference. At other times it can make a big difference in the
amount of time re-quired. Our goal is to make you aware of the various options.</p>
<p>Our next step will be to add a peaked roof to the model. Return
to <i>Create Shape 3D</i> under the <i>In-sert </i>pull down menu only this
time select<i> Pyramid</i>. When the Create Shape/Pyramid dialog win-dow
appears, fill in the data fields as shown.</p>
<p><img width=179 height=343
src="E1.files/image132.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that we placed the <i>Floor Level</i> (the base of the
pyramid) at 12 feet (the height of the walls) and said Yes to <i>With Ceiling</i>,
but No to With Floor. We also set the Ceiling Width to 0 and the Ceil-ing
Length to 75. Setting the length to 0 would generate a true pyramid. Clicking
on <i>OK</i> will add the roof to our model and produce the room shown below.
Note that the program also created the two Faces that represent the triangular
top sections of the end walls.</p>
<p>At this point, you may want to check the orientation of the
Faces to verify that EASE entered them correctly. You'll see that they are
correct. You also may want to check the Vertices to verify that EASE did not
create &quot;stacked&quot; Vertices when it placed the roof on top of the
walls. Once again, you will find that EASE took care of everything.</p>
<p>Create Shapes is a quick and easy way to create a room. As a
general rule, though, the Prototype method is even faster when one of the
prototype rooms closely resembles the room you are con-structing. Prototypes
usually include Audience Areas, Listener Seats and Loudspeakers while these
items have to be added to rooms created with Create Shapes</p>
<p>In this case, for example, the Auditory w/Peaked Roof and Church
A rooms would probably be a better choice than Create Shapes. Refer to pages
108 to 121 for more details on the use of Proto-type Rooms.</p>

<p><b>Creating Curved Surfaces</b></p>
<p>For our next modeling exercise, let's create a room with a
curved rear wall and a flat ceiling. Our room will have a 10' ceiling and be
50' wide and 80' long overall. The rear wall will have a 10 foot arc.</p>
<p>We'll start by creating the curved wall. First, we need to get
rid of the room we created in the previous exercise. Two clicks on the <i>Undo</i>
tool button should take care of this.</p>
<p>The first step will be to put in the Vertices representing the
bottom of the wall. Select <i>Circular Array/Vertices</i> from the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu and use the left mouse button to insert 3 Vertices. The first
two Vertices represent the ends of the Arc and the third, the apex of the Arc.
Don't worry about where to place the Vertices, we'll be placing them in the
right location in the next step.</p>
<p><img width=342 height=327
src="E1.files/image134.jpg"></p>
<p>After inserting the first two Vertices, the Insert Circular
Array win-dow will open. Ignore it and insert the 3rd Vertice.</p>
<p>The Insert Circular Array window allows you to precisely define
the Arc's characteristics. <i>Starting Point(ft</i>) is the beginning of the
arc, <i>Point On Arc(ft)</i> is the apex and <i>Ending Point(ft</i>) is the
finish point. The figures shown are the proper ones for the room we are
creating. Enter them into the proper fields. Hint: Use your Tab key to move from
field to field.</p>
<p>You will see the Vertices move on the screen as you type in the
correct locations. If they move off the screen, you will need to Zoom Out or
hit the Home key to see them after you finish enter-ing the location
coordinates.</p>
<p>We chose to define the Arc with 10 points. This will result in a
wall having 9 Faces. Using more points would create more Faces and a smoother
arc, but would also lengthen computation times during the simulation routines.
Approving the setup by clicking on <i>OK</i> (or hitting <i>Enter</i>) will
produce 10 Vertices in the shape of an arc.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E1.files/image135.jpg"></p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to turn these points into a Face. Choose the <i>Insert
Face [f]</i> tool and connect the Vertices together to make the Face. See
below.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E1.files/image136.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Using Extrude</b></p>
<p>We will use the Extrude feature of EASE to add walls and a
ceiling. Pick the floor Face and then right click to open the Mouse menu,
select <i>Extrude </i>and enter 10 into the<i> z </i>field of the Displacement
dialog box that opens.</p>
<p>This will extrude the Face (floor) up 10 feet and create the
curved wall and associated ceiling.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E1.files/image137.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that a front wall (face) was also created. We do not need
this, so pick it and blow it away (hit the Delete key).</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, we can add the rest of the room. We'll do this using <i>Create
Shape 3D/Cuboid</i> under the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu. We'll add a cuboid
70' in length, 10' in height and 50' in width, the size of the room minus the
curved end section, which represents the rear wall of the model. Note that the
default location for Y is 0,0,0. Since we created the curved section based on
the 0, 0, 0 point being at the center of the rear wall, we'll need to move this
point by -35. Insert -35 in the <i>Center [Ft.] y</i> field.</p>
<p>Approving the insertion by hitting <i>O</i>K will add the rest
of the room.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image002.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that once again we have an extra Face. Delete it and the
room is complete except for adding the surface materials. Simple, isn't it?</p>
<p>Hint: The quickest way to add the surface materials is to Pick a
Face, and use <i>Ctrl + F3</i> to do a global edit of surface materials. Select
the most common material used in the room, for instance PLAST/LTHR, and press <i>OK</i>
to turn all Faces (surfaces) into PLAST/LTHR. Now, only the Faces whose surface
material are not PLAST/LTHR need to be changed.</p>
<p>If the curved wall had been a semicircle, instead of an arc, we
would probably have used Create Cylinder under the Create Shape 3D menu to
create the curved section of the room. We'll take a look at using Create
Cylinder in the next exercise.</p>
<p>Note that we could also have created the cuboid section of the
room by Extruding one of the corner Vertices 50 Ft. in the x direction, 70 Ft.</p>
<p>in the y direction and 10 Ft.. in the z direction. Try it, it
works.</p>
<p>In actual practice we might have created the cuboid section of
the Room first and then added the curved rear section of the Room. Either way
works. It’s mainly a matter of personal preference.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to move on to another example, so use the Undo
icon to delete the room we just created. Be aware that if you had used F6 to
check and save data at any point while building the Room, the Undo command
wouldn’t completely delete the Room. It only goes back to the last saved point.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Creating Rooms with Curved Ceilings and Walls</b></p>
<p>For our next exercise, we'll create a more complex room. The
basic structure is 300' in width and length and has 60' walls. The peak of the
dome is 120' above the floor level. The side entrance extends out 90 feet from
the building and is 75 Ft. wide. We will call this room Circus_2</p>
<p>Notice that the building is symmetrical except for the side
entrance. We'll do all the modeling we can in the Symmetrical mode and then</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>turn off Symmetry and add the side entrance.</p>
<p>We will start the modeling process with the curved wall and
domed ceiling. Select <i>Create Shape3D</i> and use the drop down arrow to
select <i>Cylinder </i>from the Insert pull down menu to open the<i> Create
Shape /Cylinde</i>r window. Fill in the fields as shown on the next page and
then<i> </i>approve the insertion by clicking on OK.</p>
<p>Notice that we asked for a Cylinder with a floor, but without a
ceiling and for a <i>Hollow Polyhedron</i>. We want the reflective Faces on the
in-side of the cylinder. We also chose <i>12 Steps</i> instead of the default
value of 10 because this is a large room and we wanted the higher reso-lution.</p>
<p><img width=649 height=301
src="E2.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to add the dome (cupola) to the top of the
cylinder. Return to the <i>Create Shape 3D</i> menu and select <i>Cupola</i>.</p>
<p><img width=657 height=301
src="E2.files/image005.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that we specified a dome with a Ceiling and no Floor and
placed the Floor Level at 60 Ft., the height of the walls. Clicking on <i>OK</i>
produces the model shown.</p>
<p>The next step is to &quot;blow away&quot; the Faces we don't
need. It's an easy task since in the symmetrical modeling mode EASE will delete
half of them. Pick one of the Faces that need to be deleted and hit the Delete
key. You will probably find this process easier if you start with one of the
wall Faces as there are fewer of them to delete.</p>
<p>Notice that after you have deleted a Face, the program helps you
by Picking the Face numbered one lower than the Face you deleted. You don't
have to actually Pick every Face. EASE does it for you. The only thing you have
to watch for is inadvertently deleting the floor while you are getting rid of
the unwanted wall and ceiling Faces. Haste makes waste.</p>
<p>You may also want to Zoom In on the Faces at the top of the dome
when you are deleting them. It make it a little easier.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image006.jpg"></p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>When all the Faces have been deleted, your model will look like
this.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image007.jpg"></p>
<p>All that remains is to delete the unwanted Vertices. This is
done simply by using the <i>Shift +Ctrl + F12</i> key stroke command that
deletes all unattached Vertices. The result appears below.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image008.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to change the shape of the floor. The uncovered
half needs to be a rectangular instead of being circular. We’ll do this by
moving (Displacing) the Vertices in that section of the floor to form a
rectangle.</p>
<p>Select either Vertex P3 or P3*. If you aren't sure which ones
they are, there are two easy ways to find them. One is to use the <i>Ctrl + F</i>
Find command and enter P3 or P3* in the Find field; the other is to turn On all
the Vertex Labels.</p>
<p>You can also Pick the floor Vertices one by one and use the
Status Bar at the bottom of the window to check its Vertice number until you
find P3 or P3*..</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, use the right Mouse button to open the Mouse menu and
select <i>Properties</i> or hit <i>F4</i> to open the Property sheet for Vertex
P3. Change its x coordinate to -150 and <i>OK</i> the setup. Then, select <i>P1</i>
and change both its x and its y coordinates to -150. When you finish this step,
the model will look like the one shown below.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image009.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, its time to add the curved ceiling over this section..
We'll start by adding the Vertices using the <i>Insert Circular Array/Vertex</i>
function we used in the previous exercise.</p>
<p>For this exercise though, we'll use a somewhat different tact.
We’ll change the editing plane in which we are working to make it easier to
in-sert these Vertices. We’ll also change to the <i>y (end)</i> view. There are
several ways to do this. One way is to open the Options menu by clicking on the
<i>Options [F9]</i> button in the tool bar section and select the <i>Editing</i>
tab. You can also change to the end view, right click on the screen to open the
Mouse menu and select <i>xz Plane Value</i>. Another and far easier way is to
use the <i>shift +y</i> key command. It automati-cally switches to the end view
and opens the Editing tab. Try it; it works.</p>
<p><img width=387 height=323
src="E2.files/image010.jpg"></p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Set the Editing Plane to the xz - Plane and the <i>Plane Value</i>
to -150. This assures that we will be working in the end wall of the structure.</p>
<p>Now, select <i>Circular Array/Vertices</i> from the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu. Notice that the cursor changes to a cross. Click on the two
lower cor-ners of the roof and then move the cross hair to the peak of the roof
and click there.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image011.jpg"></p>
<p>The Insert Array window shown below will open as you place the
second point and you may have to move it in order to place the third point.</p>
<p><img width=339 height=323
src="E2.files/image012.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that the program placed all 3 Vertices at -150 on the
Y-axis. Some of the other coordinate values are probably not entirely correct,
so change them to the correct figures shown below. The only thing left is to
tell the program how many Vertices we want in the arc. Eleven is the correct
number, as eleven is the number of Vertices in the edge of the existing dome.
Insert 11 in the <i>Items to Insert</i> field and hit <i>OK</i> to add the
Vertices. You'll probably have to switch to the 3D view to see them.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=671 height=329
src="E2.files/image013.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, we can add the Faces. Select the <i>Insert Face [F]</i>
button in the tool bar section and add the Faces one by one. Be sure to watch
the Face orientation as they are added. If incorrect, use the Invert button in
the tool bar section. Don't forget to include Vertex P3 in the side walls and
Vertex P2 in the end wall. When all the Faces are added, the room should look
like this.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image014.jpg"></p>
<p>We chose this method of entering the end wall and the roof to
illustrate the technique and use of the Create Circular Array/Vertices feature.
There is, however, a far easier and faster way to create the end wall and roof.
It's the Extrude feature. We would have added an end wall Face to the model so
we could Extrude it and instantly create in one simple step all the walls and
ceiling sections we just finished putting in one by one. After the extrusion,
the end wall Face we created so we could Extrude it would have to be deleted,
but that's easy to do. We also would have an extra floor Face in the area we
extruded which would have to be deleted. Nevertheless, the Extrude method would
would have been easier and much faster.</p>
<p>If you haven't been saving your work regularly while you created
this model, now would be a good time to do so. Just hit <i>F6</i>.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Quitting The Symmetrical Modeling Mode</b></p>
<p>The next major step is to add the side entrance to the room and
its two support columns. Refer to the drawing on page 89 if you have for-gotten
what the completed room looks like. So far, we have been working in the symmetrical
mode. We now need to change this as the side entrance is on just one side of
the structure.</p>
<p>It is important to note that once you have left the symmetrical
mode you shouldn't try to return. To show you what happens, go to the <i>Show</i>
<i>Vertex Table (</i>click on the Vertex Table icon) to see how many Vertices
are being used. The number, if you have done everything correctly,<i> </i>is 34
which does not count the mirrored (*) Vertices. Next, close the Vertice Table
and pick one of the mirror image Vertices, P3* for exam-ple.</p>
<p>Now right click on the screen to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Room
Data</i>. Then change the editing mode from Symmetrical to non-symmetrical by
clicking on the <i>Room Symmetric</i> box. Click on <i>OK</i> to initiate the
change. Now if you go back to the <i>Show Vertex Table</i>; you will see that
59 Vertices are listed. You will also note that the P3* Vertex selected is now
designated P36. The numbers of all the mirrored Vertices were changed. The same
holds true for all the Mirrored Faces. They, too, were renumbered.</p>
<p>What happens if you try to go back to the symmetrical modeling
mode is that EASE puts in mirror images of all the existing Vertices and Faces.
You end up with 2 of everything. This is why you shouldn't try to go back.</p>
<p><b>Cutting a Face Into Two Parts (Using Fixed Cut)</b></p>
<p>Now, it's time to add the side entrance. What we need to do is
cut Face F26 (your drawing may show different Face and Vertex numbers) in half
and build the entrance hall out from the right hand section. To do this we need
another Vertex, one at the top of the Face directly above P36. We could add
this Vertex using Duplicate/Displace. However, using this approach would mean
that we would also have to blow away Face F26 and the roof section directly
above it, and then enter 3 new Faces. This is not difficult to do, but it's not
the easiest way.</p>
<p>An easier way is to use the Vertex On Face Margin and Fixed Cut
features of EASE.</p>
<p>Select Face F26 (it could be another number in your model if you
didn’t exactly follow the Tutorial instructions), then right click to open the
Mouse menu and select <i>Vertex On Face Margin</i>. The cursor will now change
to cross-hairs; center them on the edge of Face F26 above P36 and click to
insert a Vertex (P60) into the edge or margin of the Face at that point.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the program will automatically also
insert Vertex P60 into the roof section Face above Face F20. Next, select
Vertex P60 and open its Property sheet to adjust its position. It should be
placed at -75 on the Y axis.</p>
<p>The next step is to use the Fixed Cut function to cut the Face
into half. Select <i>Fixed Cut</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and
then click on Vertices P60 and P36. This will divide the Face into two parts at
that location.</p>
<p><img width=502 height=305
src="E2.files/image015.jpg"></p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>We'll use the Extrude function of EASE to complete the entrance.
Pick Face F26 (it could be an other number in your model) and use the Mouse
menu to select Extrude and open the Extrude Displacement dialog box. Enter 90 in
the <i>x:</i> field and then hit <i>OK</i> and EASE will build (extrude) Face
F26 outward 90 feet to construct the entrance.</p>
<p><img width=665 height=301
src="E2.files/image016.jpg"></p>
<p>In one simple operation you have eliminated the need to
individually enter 5 Faces; the EASE Extrude feature did it for you.</p>
<p>We no longer need Face F26 (in fact, it's actually blocking the
entrance way), so blow it away by selecting it and hitting the <i>Delete</i>
key.</p>
<p>Now, would also be a good time to check the orientation of the
entrance way Faces. One way is to Pick them one by one and if they are
in-correctly oriented, use the Invert button in the Tool Bar section or the
Mouse menu to individually turn them around. You will probably find they are
all incorrectly oriented.</p>
<p>We could have avoided this by first inverting the Face being
Extruded. It, the Face being Extruded needed to have its exposed (reflective)
surface facing the direction of the extrusion.</p>
<p>Note that we extruded the entrance way from a Face that was
perpendicular to the Y axis, so all we had to do was extrude it 90 Ft. along
the X axis. If we had placed the entrance way on one of the angled walls, and
wanted it to be perpendicular to the wall, we would have en-tered 90 inthe
Distance field, checked <i>Align to First Face and</i> pressed the <i>Face
Normal Direction</i> option offered by the Extrude function.</p>
<p>Selecting this option would have told the program that we wanted
the entrance way to be at right angles (perpendicular) to the selected Face.
Extrude would then have calculated the correct extrusion angles.</p>
<p>The EASE Extrude function is a powerful modeling tool and one
that you should get to know well. It can save you hours of modeling time once
you become familiar with it and what it can do.</p>
<p>We'll practice with it again in the next exercise.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Adding Interior Shapes</b></p>
<p>Next, we'll add the two entrance way columns. The two columns
are placed 30 feet apart on the center line of the entrance.</p>
<p>Open the <i>Create Shape 3D</i> menu under the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Cylinder</i>. The correct parameters are shown in
the left Dis-placement dialog box shown below. The parameters for the second
column are shown in the right Displacement dialog box.</p>
<p><img width=163 height=278
src="E2.files/image017.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=163 height=280
src="E2.files/image018.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that both <i>With Floor</i> and <i>With Ceiling</i> show
Yes in their Value field and that <i>Hollow Polyhedron</i> shows No. In this
case, we don't want a Hollow Polyhedron as we want the reflective Faces looking
out into the room. We said Yes to <i>With Ceiling</i> and <i>With Floor</i> to
allow EASE to insert these Faces into the entryway floor and ceiling without
creating Holes.</p>
<p>Now go back to <i>Create Shape 3D/Cylinder</i> and put in the
parameters for the second column. Note that EASE makes this easy by picking up
the parameters from the previous Cylinder. All you need to do is change the <i>Center
x</i> location. The screen on the right above has the correct settings.</p>
<p>Be aware that this will throw off the room surface area
calculations slightly unless you also Coat the top Faces of the columns to the
ceiling Face and the bottom Faces to the floor Face. This will tell the program
to subtract the surface area of these Faces from the overall surface area. You
do not need to turn the top and bottom Faces into 2-Fold Faces.</p>

<p>Before we move on, let's explore another use of Extrude.</p>
<p>Let's place a floor to ceiling column inside the main room where
the ceiling slopes and the coordinates are unknown..</p>
<p>Open the <i>Create Shape 3D/Cylinder</i> window again and change
the <i>Center [ft] x</i> coordinate to 130 and the <i>Height</i> to 0. We only
want to put in the base of the column at this time. <i>OK</i> the insertion.</p>

src="E2.files/image020.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=157 height=257

<p>Then select the Face we just inserted, right click and select <i>Extrude</i>.
Note that you probably will have to Zoom In on it in order to select it.</p>
<p>We want to extrude the Face in the + z direction, so enter 1 in
the <i>Height [ft]dz</i> field.. EASE needs to know what direction to extrude
the Face.</p>
<p>Then, open the <i>Options</i> section of the Displacement window
and put a check in <i>Extrude to Next Face</i>.</p>
<p>Hit <i>OK</i> and the program will extrude the column base to
the ceiling and place the top of the column in the slanted ceiling Face.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to add the entrance-way door to our model. The
door will be centered in the entrance way and will be 30’ wide and 24’ high.</p>
<p><img width=155 height=170
src="E2.files/image023.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Using Coat Feature</b></p>
<p><img width=223 height=154
src="E2.files/image024.jpg"></p>
<p>We know from an earlier exercise that the easy way to do this is
to Coat a two-fold Face onto the entrance-way wall. All you need to do is
insert a Vertice at x = 240, y = -22.5, Z = 0 and then ex-trude it 24’ up and
-30’ in the y direction to create the Face representing the door. Then use the
Properties folder to turn it into a Two-Fold Face and Coat it onto the wall
Face. It’s a simple 3-step procedure.</p>
<p><b>By Modeling into a Wall</b></p>
<p>Let’s explore what would be required if, for some reason, we
didn’t want to use the Coat feature.</p>
<p>Then we would have to model the door into the Face. This would
entail creating the door Face, blowing away the existing entrance-way wall
Face, and redrawing it, a more complicated procedure.</p>
<p>The steps would be:</p>
<p>1. Select the entrance-way Face and use the <i>Vertex on Face
Margin</i> procedure to place a Vertice (one of the lower corners of the door)
in the edge of the entrance-way wall Face.</p>
<p>2. Use <i>Vertex on Face Margin</i> to place the other lower
corner of the door in the edge of the entrance-way wall Face.</p>
<p>Note: If we did not use the Vertex on Face Margin to place these
two Vertices, we would also have to eventually blow away the en-trance-way
floor face and redraw it.</p>
<p>3. Use <i>Duplicate/Displac</i>e to put in the two Vertices
representing the top of the door.</p>
<p>4. Use <i>Insert Face</i> to create the door Face.</p>
<p>5 Blow away the entrance way wall Face and re-enter the wall
Face to include the 4 door Vertices. Remember. EASE wants all Ver-tices that
lie on the edge of a Face to be included in the Face.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Using Sequence</b></p>
<p><img width=275 height=248
src="E2.files/image026.jpg"></p>
<p>Our next exercise will be to add two 60' by 30' windows to the
flat face of the structure using the Sequence feature. We will put the windows
20' above the floor and space them 120' apart. Open the Insert pull down menu
and select Sequence. This will open the screen shown below.</p>
<p>Note that Sequence can be used to insert Vertices, Seats and
Loud-speakers, as well as several other items. We will be inserting Vertices.
The first step is to locate the first Vertex by inserting its x, y, z
coordi-nates into the dx, dy and dz fields. Insert 120, -150, 20. Then press
the Next button</p>
<p>Note that the coordinates you inserted now appear in the Last
Waypoint section. The window is 60' wide, so we want to place the next Vertex
60' closer to the y-axis. Insert -60 into the dx field and then hit <i>Next</i>.
The third Vertex needs to be placed 120' feet from the last one, so enter -120
into the dx field, hit the <i>Next</i> button and insert -60 for the 4th Vertex
lo-cation. Note that the locations of the new Waypoints you are entering are
relative to the location of the previous Waypoint.</p>
<p><img width=275 height=248
src="E2.files/image027.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, <i>OK</i> the Vertex sequence and EASE will place the
four Vertices in their right location.</p>
<p>The bottom Vertices are now in place. To add the top Vertices,
repeat the steps given above, except change the dz coordinate by 30. Remem-ber,
the windows are 30' high. As you can see, this feature allows you to insert a
number of irregularly spaced items quickly and easily.</p>
<p>All that remains is to create the window Faces and Coat them
onto the wall Face. Use the Insert Face [F] icon in the tool bar to add the
Faces. Don't forget to identify them as two-Fold Faces and to Coat them onto
the wall Face.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=671 height=340
src="E2.files/image029.jpg"></p>
<p>As I'm sure you realize, these windows could just as easily been
created with the Duplicate and Displace technique we used to add win-dows to
the Tutorial room (reference page 78). We used Sequence in this exercise merely
to demonstrate the technique. Also note that if the Vertices had been evenly
spaced, we would have used <i>Insert Line Array</i> , instead of Sequence.
We'll practice using the Insert Line Array feature a little later.</p>
<p><b>Using Insert Audience Area</b></p>
<p>The next step is to add an Audience Area to our building using
the <i>Insert Audience Area</i> command and the graphic modeling capabilities
of EASE. First, we will need to set the level for the Audience Area plane. Use
the right Mouse button to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Options [F9] </i>and
then open the<i> Editing </i>window. Change to the<i> xy Plane </i>and set the<i>
Plane Value </i>(the height of the plane) to 3.94', the ap-proximate height of
a seated listener's ear.</p>
<p>Note that you could have more easily accomplished the same thing
using the <i>shift + z</i> command. It would have taken you directly to the z
(overhead) view.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image030.jpg"></p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Next select the <i>Insert Audience Area [A]</i> tool and
graphically insert the Audience Area by placing its four corners at their
approximate loca-tion. As soon as the fourth point is inserted, the dialog
window shown below will open giving you an opportunity to fine tune the size
and lo-cation of the Audience Area.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image031.jpg"></p>
<p>Click on OK and the Audience Area will be correctly added to the
model.</p>
<p><b>Adding Loudspeaker Grids</b></p>
<p>Now, lets add a distributed loudspeaker system to our room.
We'll put in a grid of overhead loudspeakers 30 feet above the floor on 30'
centers. First, open the Editing tab under Options (<i>F9</i> or right click on
the screen and select <i>Options</i> from the Mouse men) or go direct to the
Editing tab with <i>Shift + z</i> and change the <i>xy plane</i> level to 30'.
If you used <i>Shift + z</i> to open the Editing window you are now using the z
or overhead view of the room. If you didn't use Shift + z to reach the Editing
tab, switch to the Z view using the <i>Z (Plan View)</i> icon or the <i>z</i>
key command.</p>
<p>While in the Options folder, you may also want to turn on the
z-Grid to aid in placing the loudspeakers. Select the Grid tab and then check
z-Grid. Hit OK.</p>
<p>Open the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and select <i>Linear
Array/Loudspeakers</i>. Next, use the cursor to place the end points of the
first loud-speaker row at its approximate location. This will open the setup
window shown below. The Starting Point and End Point coordinates most like
won't be entirely correct, so insert the correct coordinates (see below). Then,
insert the number of loudspeakers desired, in our case 9. If you want the
loudspeakers identified (labeled) put a check in the Label box. Now, click <i>OK</i>
to insert the first row of loudspeakers.</p>
<p><img width=280 height=211
src="E2.files/image032.jpg"></p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=671 height=340
src="E2.files/image033.jpg"></p>
<p>Use the same procedure to insert the other four loudspeaker rows
and you are done in a minute or two. What you want to do is to de-crease the y
coordinate by 30 for each row of loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Your room should now look like the one shown below.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image034.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, Pick one of the loudspeakers and right click to open the
Mouse menu and then select <i>Change All Same</i>. This will open a Choose
Speaker window and allow you to quickly select the loudspeaker you want to use
and change all the loudspeakers to that model. Note that you can also
accomplish the same thing with the <i>Ctrl + F3</i> key command.</p>
<p>At this point, all the loudspeakers are probably aimed down the
Y-axis instead of being pointed down at the floor. Verify this by picking one
of the loudspeakers, opening its Properties folder and turning On Show dB Cov
Cone.</p>
<p>You need to change the Vertical Angle of each loudspeaker to
-90.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>There are several ways to do this.</p>
<p><img width=177 height=281
src="E2.files/image035.jpg"></p>
<p>One is go to the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and select <i>Move
Loudspeaker</i> <i>Group</i>. This will open a selection window. Select all the
Loudspeakers in<i> </i>the first row and hit <i>OK</i>. This will turn all the
Loudspeakers in that row ”Active” and open a <i>Move Active Items</i> window.
Insert -90 in the <i>d Ver</i> field and press the <i>Go To Finger</i> icon.
This will re-aim all the loudspeakers in that row. Then follow the same
procedure for the other four rows. Note that you must do each row individually.</p>
<p>You can also use the Loudspeaker Table. Open it and select all
the loud-speakers using the Left Mouse button and the Shift key.</p>
<p><img width=636 height=318
src="E2.files/image036.jpg"></p>
<p><img width=636 height=318
src="E2.files/image037.jpg"></p>
<p>Then go to the Tools pull down menu and select <i>Set Value To</i>.
This will open a Select Value window. Select <i>Ver[o]</i> and hit <i>OK</i>.
This will introduce a prompt asking for the value, insert -90 and <i>OK</i>.
Exit the Loudspeaker Table and check the loudspeaker aiming. You'll see that
all of them have been re-aimed. It goes quickly.</p>
<p><img width=314 height=135
src="E2.files/image038.jpg"></p>
<p>Hint: Another way to quickly insert a number of loudspeakers and
a way employed by many users is to insert one loudspeaker, set its aiming and
other properties including the power level correctly, and then use the
Du-plicate/Displace and Repeat features to add and locate all the other
loud-speakers. With this technique, all loudspeakers will be properly set up
and aimed correctly when they are inserted.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Adding Steps / Bleachers</b></p>
<p>Our final exercise in the Circus project will be to add
bleachers along one wall. Let's make them 140' long and start them 6.5' from
the end wall. We'll let them come 15 feet out into the room and assume that
each seat is 18 inches deep and 18 inches above the previous seat. For the
moment, let's also assume the seats have no backs.</p>
<p>Amazingly, we only need to know the x, y, z coordinates for one
Vertex to construct the bleachers. These are needed to locate the first Vertex
after it has been inserted using the Insert Vertex [v] con. Then, its a simple
matter of using the Duplicate/Displace function to add the other three Vertices
that define the first row of seats and to create the Face. Duplicate/Displace
and Repeat can then be used to make additional rows of seats.</p>
<p><img width=120 height=252
src="E2.files/image039.jpg"></p>
<p>Use -135, -143.5, 1.5 as the coordinates for the first Vertex.
Then Duplicate it and Displace (move) it 1.5 ' closer to the wall (-1.5). Then
Duplicate/Displace it 140' along the Y axis; then Duplicate/Displace this
Vertex 1.5' away from the wall. Make a mental note of the Vertices P numbers as
you put them in.</p>
<p>Use the Insert Face [f] button to make the Face representing the
first row of seats. Make sure you identify it as a Two-Fold Face. It is
suspended in the room (not touching any wall or floor surfaces, so it needs to
be a Two-Fold Face.</p>
<p>You may run into problems putting in this Face using the Insert
Face tool, because the Vertices at the ends of the Face are so close together
on the screen that it's hard to pick the right one. At other times, the program
will have difficulty telling which of the Vertices you want to select. When
this happens, a prompt asking you to choose between two or more Vertice numbers
will appear. Make the choice and click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Using the Zoom key commands (F11 &amp; F12) or the Ctrl + Arrow
keys to zoom in on the Vertices will help make this process easier and faster.</p>
<p>A way to get around this is to use the <i>New Item</i> icon in
the tool bar. Clicking on it produces a Select Item dialog box asking what you
wish to create. Choosing Face and clicking OK will produce another dialog box
asking if you want to create a new Face. Answer Yes and the Properties window
for a new Face will appear. . Use the Change button and the Choose Vertex
window to one-by-one change the default Vertices listed to the ones defining
the Face you are adding and click on OK to create the Face. It only takes a few
seconds.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>After the Face that represents the first row of seats is
created, right click on the Face to bring up the Mouse menu, select <i>Duplicate</i>.
When the Displacement screen appears, displace this Face up 1.5' and back 1.5'
(displace Z by 1.5 and X by -1.5. Then, insert 8 into the Repeated field.</p>
<p><img width=150 height=163
src="E2.files/image041.jpg"></p>
<p>Clicking on <i>OK</i> will then automatically Duplicate and
Displace the Face 8 times. The result appears below. The bleachers, of course,
have no seat backs and appear to be suspended in space which,of course, they
are.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image042.jpg"></p>
<p>If you don’t like this illusion or if you want to dress up the
drawing, use the <i>Insert Edge [e]</i> icon to tie the ends of the seats
together and to put in a base. (Note that you'll need to add Vertices at the
intersection of the wall and the floor to outline the base.)</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image043.jpg"></p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Putting in these Edges will not alter the Room characteristics;
it just dresses up the drawing and makes it look like the seats have backs.</p>
<p>Remember, in EASE, Edges have no acoustical properties.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image044.jpg"></p>
<p>If the seats have backs, adding backs to them is as easy as it
was to put in the seats. Select the <i>Insert Face [f]</i> icon and then click
on the four Vertices that outline the space between the first and second row of
seats to insert the first seat back. Then select this Face and right click to
bring up the Mouse menu, select Duplicate. When the Displacement screen appears,
displace this Face up 1.5' and back 1.5' (change X by -1.5 and Z by 1.5). Then,
insert 8 into the Repeated field. This will Duplicate and Displace the Face 8
times.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image045.jpg"></p>
<p>The Duplicate/Displace technique we used produces
&quot;stacked&quot; Vertices. If you take a close look at the bleacher Vertices
by Picking them, you'll notice that there are two Vertices &quot;stacked&quot;
on top of each other at most points. Key command <i>Ctrl + F12</i> will fix
this problem. Try it and see what happens.</p>
<p>Note that if these bleachers were made from concrete or
otherwise enclosed, we would have needed to use single sided Faces and mod-eled
the bleachers into the wall and floor.</p>

<p><b>Using Prototype Rooms</b></p>
<p>Many of the rooms you will be modeling will fit into a
relatively few basic categories. EASE provides a library of basic room
Prototypes that can be quickly modified into close approximations of actual
rooms. In many cases, using these Prototype rooms can dramatically speed up the
room-modeling process. Drawings of the 33 different Prototype rooms included in
EASE are at the end of this section. Please take a few minutes to familiarize
yourself with the variety of models available.</p>
<p>There are two ways to access the Prototypes. The first is to
access them from the Insert pull down menu while in the Edit Project mode.</p>
<p>The other way is from the Desktop. We'll go through the Edit
Project approach first.</p>
<p>Earlier we decided that Church (A) was similar to the Tutorial
room we were building, so we'll use the Church (A) Prototype in this exercise.
We'll call it Church(A) and store it in its own folder, instead of in the
Tutorial folder as we have in the past. From the Main <i>File</i> pull down
menu choose <i>New Project</i> and type Church(A) in both the <i>Hall</i> and
the <i>Project File Name</i> fields and then click on <i>Create</i>. Answer <i>OK</i>
to the Project Path prompt that appears.</p>
<p><img width=301 height=114
src="E2.files/image046.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, open <i>Room Info/Data</i> under the <i>View</i> pull down
menu and enter Church(A) in the <i>Project Version</i> field.</p>
<p><img width=153 height=208
src="E2.files/image047.jpg"></p>
<p>Then open the Edit Project module (<i>Project Data</i> under the
<i>Edit</i> pull down menu). When the Edit Project module opens, select <i>Load
Prototypes</i> from the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu. This will open the Load
Proto-type menu and an outline drawing of the Amphitheater Prototype.</p>
<p>Use the drop down listing (click on the Down Arrow button) to
locate and select <i>Church (A)</i>. Then press the <i>Assemble Room</i>
button. A Replace Actual Prototype prompt will appear; answer <i>Yes</i>. This
will open the dimensional table for Church (A) and an outline drawing of the
room.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315

<p>108</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>If we had used the Desktop method of reaching the Prototypes, we
would have bypassed the first Load Prototype screen. From the Main screen we
would have selected <i>Start Working</i>, then clicked on <i>Create Project</i>
and when the Prototype icons appeared selected <i>Church (A)</i> by double
clicking on it. This would have opened the Project Options window with Church
(A) already inserted in the Hall and Project File Name fields. Clicking on <i>Create</i>
would then have opened the dimensional table for Church (A) and the outline
drawing of the Church(A) prototype.</p>
<p>Notice that selecting one of the dimension blocks, such as <i>Height</i>,
highlights that item in the drawing to prevent you from changing the wrong
dimension.</p>
<p><img width=435 height=326
src="E2.files/image049.jpg"></p>
<p>Change the dimensions to match the dimensions of our Model_1
room. Remember it was 75 Feet long, 50 feet wide, 12 feet to to top of the
walls and the peak was at 25 feet. The Chancel area (stage) was elevated two
feet and there were two 1 foot steps. You can at any time during this process
view on the screen any changes you have made by hitting <i>Apply</i>. Change
the initial dimensions to match our Model_1 dimensions and then click on <i>Apply</i>
and <i>OK</i>. This will convert the Prototype into a working EASE model</p>
<p><img width=435 height=326

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>There are 3 notable differences between this room and the
Model_1 room we created; The end walls are made of only one Face (instead of
being two separate Faces), there are no steps leading up to the Chancel area
and the seating areas are not defined. All can be easily corrected.</p>
<p>Use <i>Fixed Cut</i> to divide each of the end Faces into two
parts (select <i>Fixed Cut</i> from the <i>Tool</i>s pull down menu and then
click on the two Vertices at the top of the wall).</p>
<p>Adding the steps is a little more complicated. First, blow away
(delete) the Main Floor and the Wall Faces. Then, use Vertice on Face Mar-gin
to add two Vertices to the front of the 2 foot high Chancel Face and use Fixed
Cut to cut the Face into two 1 foot high Faces. Extrude the bottom face 1 foot
forward (in the -y direction) and then delete the three unneeded faces formed
during the extrusion. The final step is to re-enter the Main Floor and Side
Wall Faces. You will be surprised how little time it takes.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image051.jpg"></p>
<p>The Seating Areas can be added using the Coat feature just as
you did in the Model_1 exercise.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that the default Wall Material for prototype Faces
is Absorber and this needs to be changed to the correct wall materials.
Oth-erwise very bit of sound that strikes a surface will be immediately
absorbed and there will be no reflections. EASE cannot calculate RT times for a
room with no reflections as there is no reverberation.</p>
<p>Most rooms have one material that is dominate, i.e., used on
most of the Faces. With that in mind, Pick one of the Faces with the dominate
material and then right click to open the Mouse menu. Select <i>Change All Same</i>
and change the wall material on all of the Faces to the dominate material and
then individually change the remaining Faces.</p>

<p><b>Using Objects</b></p>
<p>One of the most useful EASE modeling features is the ability to
group together a number of items (Vertices, Faces, Edges, Speakers, etc.) into
a single item or Object as its called by the program. Objects can be created
from items of different types and can then be duplicated, moved and saved as an
Object for use in other models.</p>
<p>Let's start our investigation of Objects by creating a new
project. This time we'll use the Desktop Icons and Prototypes to quickly create
a new model. From the opening window, double click on <i>Start Working</i>,
then select <i>Create Projec</i>t and <i>Church(A</i>). We'll call our new
project Church_2 and put it in the Tutorial folder. When the Project Options
screen opens insert Tutorial in the <i>Hall</i> field and Church2 in the <i>Project</i>
<i>File Name </i>field and then click on<i> Creat</i>e.</p>
<p>Our model will be similar to the prototype Church(A), except for
having a height of 60', width of 60', length of 120' and five 2' by 1' wooden
beams (rafters) on 20' centers. When the Prototype screen opens, change the
dimensions to show a total Height of 60 feet, Breadth (width) of 60 feet and
Length of 103.6 feet (the stage is 16.4 feet deep). Hit <i>Apply</i> and then <i>OK</i>.
Then return to the Main window and go to <i>Room Info/Data </i>under the<i>
View </i>pull down menu; enter Church_2 in the<i> Project Version </i>field and<i>
OK</i>. Then open the Edit Project module.<i> </i>See how quick and easy it is
to build a working model.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image085.jpg"></p>
<p>We'll use Duplicate/Displace to put in the first beam. Select
one of the corner Vertices at the top of the rear wall (P6* for example) and
Du-plicate/Displace it by 20' along the x axis (displace it 20 in the y field).
Then Extrude the new Vertice 1 in the y direction and -2 in the the z direction
to Extrude the Face representing the end of the beam.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image086.jpg"></p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to extrude the Face you just created -30 in the
X direction to create the beam.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image087.jpg"></p>
<p>Now Displace the center Face by 43.60 in the z direction (the
roof peak is at 60 feet and the top of the beam at 16.4 feet, the height of the
wall). It’s that simple.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image088.jpg"></p>
<p>Hint: If you had forgotten the height of the roof peak or the
height of the wall, select one of the appropriate Vertices and read the z
coordi-nate from the status bar at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>The next step is to turn the beam into an Object that can be
easily duplicated and moved. There are three ways to do this:</p>
<p><i>1. Activate </i>all the items you want included
in the Object and then use<i> Create Object </i>under the<i> Insert </i>Pull
down menu to turn them into<i> </i>an Object.</p>
<p>2. Open <i>Create Objec</i>t and use the Magic Wand to select
the items and add them to a list of items to be included in the Object.</p>
<p>3. Open <i>Create Object</i> and use the Item Tables to
select and add the desired items to the list of items to be included.</p>
<p>Note that Objects can also be created while Extruding an item.
We’ll practice that, too. We’ll try all of these methods, starting with the Add
Active Items approach.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Use your Mouse and individually Pick (select) all the items that
will be included in the Object; select an item using the Pick Tool and then
right click to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Activate</i> or use the <i>F8</i>
key command. Repeat the procedure until all of the items that will be included
in the Object have been Activated. Notice that you must individually Activate
each item. EASE will not automatically Activate mir-ror image items. Then
select <i>Create Objec</i>t from the <i>Inser</i>t pull down menu to open the
dialog box shown below.</p>
<p><img width=457 height=455
src="E2.files/image089.jpg"></p>
<p>Answering <i>Yes</i> will open the Edit Object win-dow shown to
the right. Notice that under Items it shows all the Vertices included in the
Faces we turned Active. If you aren’t sure of this click on the Faces radio
button and the items listing will change to show the Faces in-cluded in the
Image.</p>
<p>Notice that this window also gives you the op-portunity to name
(Label) the Object and in-clude a description.</p>
<p>The Add Active, Add Picked, and Add Faces buttons are used to
add an item to the list.</p>
<p>The Edit tab opens a new window which gives you the opportunity
to change the Wall Materials used in the Object, their color when viewed in the
Eyes module and their Texture in Vision.</p>
<p><img width=410 height=328
src="E2.files/image090.jpg"></p>
<p>The Axis tab allows you to set the Point Of Origin (insertion
point) for the Object.</p>
<p>Be aware that if you aren’t sure where to place the Point Of
Origin, you can use Apply to check out its location in the room model and then
change the Point Of Origin if you don’t like it. The Object symbol lets you
know where it is located.</p>
<p>Clicking on <i>OK</i> will turn the selected items into an
Object. See next page.</p>
<p>Note: You will not be able to see the Object symbol unless <i>Objects</i>
is checked under the <i>Items </i>pull down menu</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that the only change in the Room drawing is the addition
of the Object symbol.</p>
<p><img width=506 height=316
src="E2.files/image091.jpg"></p>
<p>The big difference is that the Object can be treated as a single
item and Duplicated, Displaced, Moved and Saved As an Object and filed away for
use in another project. The individual items in the Object retain their
original identities and can be modified.</p>
<p>Now that we have the Object created the rest is a snap. Select the
Object, use the right mouse button to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Duplicate</i>.
When the Displacement dialog box opens, insert 20 in the<i> </i><u>y</u><i> </i>field
and 4 in the<i> Repeated </i>field. Then press<i> OK </i>to add 4 more<i> </i>beams
in their correct location.</p>
<p><img width=506 height=316
src="E2.files/image092.jpg"></p>
<p>This would be a good time to check the Room for Holes. Go to <i>Room
Data</i> (right click on screen and then select <i>Room Data</i>) and make sure
<i>Room Open</i> isn’t checked. The Room needs to be closed before you check
for holes. Then select <i>Check Holes</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu
and anticipate the Well Done prompt.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The second method of creating an Object is the Magic Wand. To
explore this method, open Create Objects under the Insert pull down menu, only
this time answer <i>No</i> to the Assign Active Items prompt. This will open
the Edit Object window. Select the Wand and then return to the Edit Project
screen and use the Wand and the left Mouse button to individually select the
desired items (Faces). Then right click on the selected item to add it to the
Object. A musical tone will tell you that the item has been added successfully.</p>
<p>You may want to minimize the Edit Object window while using the
Wand to select items. If you do, restore the Edit Object window after you have
finished selecting the items, define the Point of Origin and click on <i>OK</i>
to create the Object.</p>
<p>The third method of creating an Object make use of the project’s
Item Tables. To explore this method, open <i>Create Object</i> under the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu and then cancel the Use Active Items Prompt when it opens. When
the Edit Object screen opens, select the Items tab, if it isn’t already
selected, and choose one of the items listed, Faces for example.</p>
<p>Then press the <i>Select</i> button to open a listing of all the
Faces in the project. Now, all you need to do is select the Faces you want
included in the Object. If you don't know the Face numbers, return to the Edit
Project window, turn on the Face Labels and make note of their num-bers. Then
return to the Edit Object window and select/add them to the Object. Hint: To
select multiple items hold down the <i>Ctrl</i> key while using the left mouse
button to select them one by one.</p>
<p><img width=361 height=289
src="E2.files/image093.jpg"></p>
<p>When you are finished selecting them, click on <i>OK</i> and
then on <i>OK</i> again to create the Object.</p>
<p><img width=157 height=299
src="E2.files/image094.jpg"></p>
<p>Objects can also be created directly from Create Shape 3D under
the Insert pull down menu. To see how this works, let's assume that our room
has large circular windows 4 feet in diameter in both end walls.</p>
<p>Go to <i>Create Shape 3D</i> and select <i>Cylinder.</i> When
the Create Shape screen opens, fill in the fields as shown. We're going to
place the window 30 feet above the floor in the rear wall.</p>
<p>Note that we listed the Height of the cylinder as 0 (we just
want a circular Face and not a cylinder) and put a check in the <i>Create
Object</i> box.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>Chapter 4: Advanced Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the program created an Object just where we wanted it.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image095.jpg"></p>
<p>The only problem is that it's not upright. Not a problem,
really. Use the right Mouse button to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Move</i>.
When the Move screen appears, use the <i>Aiming</i> section to rotate the
Object 90 degrees vertically. Now, the window is exactly where we want it.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image096.jpg"></p>
<p>But, it looks a little small. We must have been looking for a
window 8 feet in diameter and not 4 feet. Again, no problem. Use the Mouse menu
again and select <i>Scale</i>. Enter 2 into the field and hit <i>OK</i>. Now
the window is the correct size.</p>
<p>All that is left to do is to turn the window into a 2-Fold face
and Coat it onto the end wall.</p>
<p>Obviously, at this point we can use Duplicate/Displace to add a
second window and move it to the front wall</p>

<p>Create Objects is a powerful tool. With Create Objects and a
little imagination you can easily solve many of your modeling problems. You can
also use it to dress up your model. You can, for example, take a few minutes to
create a nice looking church pew as an Object and then save it and use it in
place of Listener Seats in all your future church models.</p>

<p><b>Packing a Project</b></p>
<p>Before we move on to Cluster Construction, let’s Pack the
project away for storage or shipment. Packed files are the best way to store
your old project files. They also are the best way to e-mail a project to an
associate.</p>
<p>Open the project you want to Pack and then select <i>Pack
Project</i> from the <i>File</i> pull down menu. This will open the familiar
Name and Desti-nation dialog window shown below. Verify or rename the project
and its storage location and then click on <i>Save.</i></p>
<p><img width=372 height=256
src="E2.files/image098.jpg"></p>
<p>Clicking on <i>Save</i> will open the Prompt shown below.
Answering <i>OK</i> will compress the Project file and store it away.</p>

<p><b>Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p>It is now time to become familiar with the loudspeaker cluster
building capabilities within EASE 4.3. The associated SpeakerLab program which
also includes cluster building capabilities will be covered separately.</p>
<p>EASE 4.3 provides loudspeaker cluster construction facilities in
two locations; the Main Speaker Base module and the Edit Project (Room Editor)
module. The same algorithms are used in both modules, only the applications are
different.</p>
<p><b>Main SpeakerBase Cluster Module</b></p>
<p>The Main SpeakerBase module is mainly used to show, analyze and
investigate the performance of various loudspeaker array combi-nations in free space.
Then, if the performance is up to expectations, the array can be saved and
installed in projects just as if it was a single loudspeaker.</p>
<p><b>Edit Project Module</b></p>
<p>The Edit Project module allows Clusters to be built within the
project and saved as a Cluster. It also allows existing loudspeaker ar-rays,
including ones imported as part of an EASE 2.1 project to be converted into a
Cluster and treated as a single loudspeaker.</p>
<p>Multi-loudspeaker arrays (and Clusters) can also be turned into
an Object (a .fla loudspeaker array file) and saved for use in other projects.</p>
<p>We'll cover this approach later in this section.</p>
<p>All three methods allow you to save and store popular arrays so
you can reuse them in other projects without having to reconstruct them.</p>
<p><b><i>Note that the directivity balloons for
Clusters are calculated only for the Far Field. As a result, Clusters should
not be relied upon for Near Field investigations. For Near Field
investigations, clusters can and should be Exploded (turned back to their
orig-inal multi-cabinet status) and then regrouped into a Cluster after the
investigation.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Clusters can also be constructed in
SpeakerLab and turned into a GLL file. Clusters created in SpeakerLab provide
both accurate Near and Far Field calculations. For details go to Chapter 14:
SpeakerLab.</i></b></p>
<p>Treating Clusters as a single loudspeaker reduces calculation
times, especially in Ray Tracing. Computation times are directly proportional
to the number of loudspeakers (i.e., doubling the number of loudspeakers
doubles the computation time). Please note that the saving in computation times
is most significant in Ray Tracing investigations. The times required for
energy and intelligibility mapping are usually short and the time savings are
not as significant. The accuracy of the calculations is not affected by the use
of &quot;Clusters&quot; in the Far Field.</p>
<p>Multi-loudspeaker arrays saved as Objects in a *.fla file are
treated by EASE as multiple loudspeakers, allowing the program to correctly
calculate interference in both the Near and Far Fields. The computation time,
of course, is longer than the time required for &quot;Cluster&quot;
calcu-lations.</p>
<p>We'll start our Cluster exercise using the Main SpeakerBase
module. Return to the <i>Main</i> menu, open the <i>File</i> pull down menu and
select <i>Main Databases/Speaker Models/SpeakerBase</i>. This will open the
EASE Main SpeakerBase program module. Open the<i> File </i>pull down<i> </i>menu
and select <i>New Cluster</i>. Note that the Edit Cluster Speaker window that
opens is identical to the one we have used in Edit Project, except for some of
the tool buttons being inactive.</p>
<p>Our next step will be to set the Editing plane to make it easier
to insert the loudspeakers. Open the Options window by pressing the <i>Op-tions
[F9] </i>icon in the tool bar section, select the<i> Editing </i>tab, the
xy-plane and set the<i> Plane Value </i>to 0.<i> OK </i>the change. Now select
the<i> In-sert Loudspeaker [l] </i>icon and click anywhere on the red x-axis
line. When the Property sheet appears, set the x value to 3. Then, repeat<i> </i>the
process to add another loudspeaker at -3. Your screen should now look like the
one shown at the top of the next page.</p>
<p>Note that if you had used the <i>Shift + z</i> key command to
enter the Editing tab in the Options folder, instead of following the
directions in the previous paragraph, your screen automatically changed to the
Top or Overhead view instead of the 3D view.</p>
<p>The program inserted the loudspeakers as Spheres, the default
loudspeaker. To change the loudspeaker model numbers, select one of the
loudspeakers and use either the <i>Ctrl + F3</i> key command to open the <i>Change
All Same</i> window or right click to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Change
all Same</i>. ( You also could use the <i>F2</i> key command or <i>Change
Speaker Model</i> in in the Mouse menu to change the models individually).
Then, use the <i>Browse</i> and <i>Change</i> buttons to select the desired
model. We will use the Renkus-Heinz STX4/44 for both loud-speakers.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5: Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p><img width=671 height=412
src="E2.files/image101.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that changing to the STX4/44 Introduced outline (wireframe)
drawings (Case drawings) of the loudspeaker. We will need the Case drawings to
make sure our Cluster is physically possible. If you chose to use another
loudspeaker and the wireframe drawing doesn’t ap-pear it’s probably because the
manufacturer of the loudspeaker you chose did not include a Case drawing in his
loudspeaker file. Another possibility is that the Case drawings are not
selected in the Options folder.</p>
<p>You can verify the Case drawing setting by going to the Options
folder (<i>F9</i> or right click on the screen and select <i>Options</i>) and
opening the <i>Items </i>tab. Symbols and Cases should be checked.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>The Cluster module is going to want both loudspeakers designated
as Active loudspeakers, so select (pick) one of them and then open its Mouse
menu by right clicking to open the Mouse menu and select <i>Activate.</i> Note
that the loudspeaker symbol is now red instead of being blue when it is not
selected to show that it is Active. Repeat the procedure with the other
loudspeaker. Another way of turning the loud-speaker Active is the <i>F8</i>
key command. Selecting the loudspeaker and then pressing the <i>F8</i> key
command will turn the loudspeaker Active. Note that pressing <i>F8</i> a second
time would deactivate the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>We are now ready to see how our cluster performs. Press <i>F5</i>
to Check Data and then open the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and select <i>Recom-pute
Cluster</i>. This will open the screen shown below.</p>
<p><img width=374 height=278
src="E2.files/image103.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Position (Ft.)</i> and <i>Aiming (deg)</i> fields are
used primarily to place and aim clusters in the Edit Project mode. <i>Position
(Ft.)</i> places the center (reference point) of the Cluster and <i>Aiming
(deg)</i> sets up the reference axis. For our purposes, the Average or Default
settings are fine.</p>
<p>We'll also accept the <i>Complex Integration Method</i> of
calculating the cluster's performance. It uses running time complex
interference to cal-culate the directivity balloon and gives the most realistic
results. <i>Power Summation</i> uses simple energy addition for the
calculations and the <i>Convolution Method</i> uses a formula developed by Mark
Ureda. Approving the setup by clicking on <i>OK</i> will produce the wire
lattice screen shown below. Note that it may be hidden by the Edit Cluster
screen, so minimize the Edit Cluster screen if you can't see the wire lattice
screen.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>As you can see, it's difficult to read. To get a better picture,
open the <i>Mapping</i> pull down menu and select <i>Render Balloon.</i> Render
Balloon offers a wide range of far more descriptive displays. A top (overhead)
view of the cluster balloon is shown below.</p>
<p><img width=516 height=326
src="E2.files/image105.jpg"></p>
<p>Use the Zoom [F11] tool and the scroll bars to study the
cluster's performance. Notice the severity of the lobing. If you can't see all
the col-ors in the color chart, open the Utilities pull down menu and select
either <i>Show Legend</i> or <i>Insert Legend</i>. This will introduce a new
color legend with scroll bars so you can identify all the colors.</p>
<p>This cluster's severe lobing is typical for a pair of
loudspeakers mounted side by side, but a few feet apart. It shows in a very
graphic fash-ion why this type of arrangement should be avoided..</p>
<p>We obviously need to bring the loudspeakers together into a
&quot;tight pack&quot; array. This means we have to return to the Edit Cluster
window. If the Balloon screen is obscuring the Edit Cluster window, either
minimize it or click on the Edit Cluster icon in the Windows status bar at the
bottom of the screen. Start by switching the screen from the 3D view to Top
view (Use the Down Arrow icon in the Tool bar.)</p>

<p>Pick S1 and then open its Properties folder. Then change the x
value from 3 to 0.5 and hit <i>Apply</i> to see the result. Now you see why
it’s important to have the Case drawing. The array isn’t physically possible as
the loudspeaker cabinets overlap.</p>
<p>Note that the previous paragraph assumed you were in the
symmetrical modeling mode. If you are not, you will need to select S2 and
change it to -0.5 before you can see the overlap.</p>
<p>It's also apparent that we need to rotate the cabinets.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315

<p>The STX4/44 is an 18 degree trapezoidal cabinet. Insert 18 into
the <i>Hor. Angle</i> field and view the result using <i>Apply</i>. Next, try
0.37 as the X value. This should put S1 into the correct position. <i>OK</i>
the changes.</p>
<p>Now repeat the operation with S2, only change the x value to

<p>To view the performance, hit <i>F5</i> to tell the program to
Check Data. This will also transfer the data from its temporary storage spot to
the Main file, assuming Auto Apply is turned <i>On</i> in the Main Option menu.
Then open the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and select <i>Recompute Clus-ter. OK
</i>the setup and then view the wire lattice screen presentation. Now go to the<i>
Mapping </i>pull down menu and select<i> Render Balloon</i>.<i> </i>As you can
see most of the severe lobing has disappeared.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315

<p>In this exercise we brought the two loudspeakers together by
using their Properties folders. Another way, and the one that is usually used,
is to use the <i>Shift + Arrow</i> Key Commands to move the loudspeakers. To
see how this works, select one of the loudspeakers and then hit <i>Shift +
Right Arrow. </i>The selected loudspeaker undoubtedly moved far more than you
anticipated. That is because the default Stepwidth<i> </i>setting is 3.28 feet.
Right click on the screen to open the Mouse Menu, select <i>Stepwidth</i> and
change the Step distance to .02 or .03 and <i>OK</i>. Then, use the<i> Shift +
Arrow Key Commands </i>to move the loudspeakers. It's the easy way to go when
you don’t know the exact coordi-nates.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>Now, that we are happy with the cluster's performance, it is
time to save it as a single loudspeaker. Return to the Main Speaker Base
win-dow, open the <i>File</i> pull down menu and select <i>Save Speaker</i> (or
use the <i>Ctrl + s</i> key command). A prompt will appear asking you to name
the loudspeaker. Use Cluster_1 as the name, verify that the location in which
the file is being saved is the location where you want it saved and then click
on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>To verify that a new loudspeaker file has been created, reopen
the Circus_2 project created in the previous exercise and select the Insert
Loudspeaker [l] tool. Click on the screen and when the Loudspeaker Properties
window appears place the loudspeaker at 0, 30, 45. Press the [.] change button
and then Browse to open the loudspeaker database. Select <i>Cluster_1</i>, add
it to the project menu and <i>OK</i>. Now ap-prove the insertion by hitting <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Zoom in on the Loudspeaker and you'll see the two cabinet
cluster was added as a single loudspeaker. Although the wireframe shows two
cabinets, there is only one loudspeaker symbol.</p>
<p><img width=516 height=323
src="E2.files/image111.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that if the wireframe doesn’t show in the model, it’s
because you are still in the symmetrical modeling mode. Go the Room Data (right
click on the screen and select Room Data) and turn off (uncheck) <i>Room
Symmetric</i>.</p>
<p>The Cluster Program enables you to construct clusters of
different sizes and types, study their performance and then save them for
future use. You are encouraged to spend a few minutes modeling some of the
clusters you have used in your projects and studying their perform-ance. Try
changing models to see how much difference this makes. What you find may
surprise you. You will learn that all loudspeakers are not created equal when
it comes to cluster performance. Some loudspeakers, such as the SRX4/44, array
much better than others.</p>
<p>One word of caution. EASE cannot accurately calculate the performance
of clusters unless it has accurate phase information on the loud-speakers used
in the cluster. Many of the loudspeaker files in 4.3 were imported from earlier
versions of EASE and do not include phase information. As a result, EASE 4.3 is
not able to accurately project their performance in clusters.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure phase information is included in the
loudspeaker you are using, go to the Loudspeaker DataBase, open the
Loud-speaker’s folder, and select <i>Phase Data</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull
down menu. If the spreadsheet contains only 0s, (zeros), phase data is not
in-cluded.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 5: Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Using Edit Project to Build Clusters</b></p>
<p>Now, lets try out the Cluster building capabilities of the Edit
Project module. Delete the cluster we just added to the Circus_2 model. We are
going to build the same cluster using the Edit Project program module. We'll
start by switching to the overhead view and using the Mouse menu to select <i>Edit
xy Plane</i>. Set the Plane level at 48 Ft.. Then use the <i>Insert Loudspeaker
[l]</i> icon in the tool bar sor to insert a loudspeaker. When the Loudspeaker
Properties sheet opens, insert the loudspeakers exact location (set x to 3 and
y to 30).</p>
<p>Note that the program placed the loudspeaker at a height of 45
Ft., the editing plane we set up. We want to use the same loudspeakers we used
in the previous cluster example, so select the STX4/44. (Use the <i>[.]</i>
change button to open the selection window and select the STX4/44.) Then <i>OK</i>.
Use the Insert <i>Loudspeaker [l</i>] icon to insert the second loudspeaker at
x = - 3 and Y = 0.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E2.files/image112.jpg"></p>
<p>The loudspeakers need to be turned Active. Use the Activate
command in the Mouse menu to individually turn them Active or go to the <i>Item
</i>pull down menu and choose<i> Select Active Items/Loudspeakers</i>. Turn
them<i> On</i>. Now it is time to Check Data again [<i>F5]</i>. Then open the<i>
Insert </i>pull down menu and select<i> Calculate Cluste</i>r Note that we are
duplicating the steps we took in the previous example when we cre-ated a
cluster using the Main Speaker Base program. As soon as you <i>OK</i> the
setup, EASE will ask you to name the cluster.</p>
<p>After you finish naming the cluster, EASE will calculate its
performance and then ask if you want to Replace Active Loudspeakers. Answer-ing
<i>Yes</i> will change the screen to the one shown below. Note that the two
loudspeaker symbols turned into a single symbol centered be-tween the two wireframe
drawings. The program now sees the two loudspeakers as a single device.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The program also asks if you want to Show Balloon. Answering <i>Yes</i>
will open the 3-D balloon display showing the clusters performance. A quick
comparison between this balloon and the one generated in the Main Speaker Base
example will show you that they are identical.</p>
<p>You can obtain further verification of this by ungrouping the
cluster and then moving the two loudspeakers together as we did in the
previ-ous exercise. To do this, go to the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and
select <i>Explode Cluster</i>. It's that simple. Now, proceed to bring the
loud-speakers together just like you did before and then make a Cluster just as
you did before. When you are done, you'll again see that the performance is the
same as the Cluster built under the Main Speaker Base program.</p>
<p><b>Several words of caution</b>:</p>
<p><b>1. Cluster performance is calculated only for the Far
Field and should not be utilized for Near Field simulations.</b></p>
<p><b>2. If the distance between the loudspeakers in an array
is too great, the cluster algorithms show results similar to those ob-tained
with single loudspeakers because of the small amount of interference between
the individual loudspeakers. The rule is that the distance between loudspeakers
should not be greater than a wavelength at 100 Hz for meaningful results.
Trying to evaluate lower frequencies is of little value because the patterns
are essentially non directional.</b></p>
<p><b>Turning Clusters into Objects</b></p>
<p>It's easy to turn loudspeaker arrays into an Object having many
of the same characteristics as a Cluster. As an Object they can be Dupli-cated,
Displaced, Turned, Rotated and Saved as a single item just like any other
Object. They also look just like a Cluster.</p>
<p>The main difference is that the individual Loudspeakers retain
their identity and are not grouped together as a single loudspeaker, as they
are in the Cluster module. This allows EASE to correctly calculate both the
free space Far Field directivity balloon and the individual Near Field
directivity balloons. The entire directivity behavior is distance related
correct, both in the Far Field and in the Near Field. The other difference you
will notice is that instead of being saved as an .obj file like other Objects,
Cluster Objects are saved as a .fla file containing all the loudspeaker
Properties.</p>
<p>Let's try it out. Return to the Circus_2 model, select the
Cluster, go to the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and select <i>Explode Cluster</i>
to turn the Cluster back into two individual loudspeakers. Then go back to the <i>Insert</i>
pull down menu and use Create Object to turn the two loud-speakers into an
Object. If you have forgotten the steps to creating an Object or skipped that
part of the Tutorial return to page 123 to re-view the steps.</p>
<p>When you are done, the Object (Cluster) will look like this.</p>
<p><img width=516 height=323

<p>138</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5: Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that you can still select the loudspeakers individually and
manipulate them just like you can any individual loudspeaker. You can ro-tate,
turn, move, adjust power levels, change models, etc. The loudspeakers are also
treated individually in all calculations and all calcula-tions performed with
these arrays will take longer than those performed with a Cluster. But, when <i>Interference</i>
is turned On they will be more accurate in the Near Field. In the Far Field the
results will be the same.</p>
<p>Of course, Cluster Objects can also be saved and used again in
other projects. Select the Object and use the mouse menu and <i>Save As</i>.</p>
<p><b>Creating Case Drawings</b></p>
<p>Case or Wireframe drawings serve two useful functions. First,
they allow you to verify that the loudspeaker placement(s) are physically
possible; i.e., that part of the cabinet doesn't protrude through the ceiling
or that the cabinets in an array are not overlapping. They are also useful in
showing clients how the loudspeaker(s) will appear in their room.</p>
<p>Creating Case drawings (Wireframe drawings) for loudspeakers
that do not have a Case drawing is a relatively simple procedure and does not
affect the Loudspeaker's authentication. You can create a Case drawing for any
loudspeaker and save it without losing the loud-speakers authentication.</p>
<p>Open the <i>File</i> pull down menu in the EASE Main menu window
and select <i>Main Databases/Speaker Model</i>s/SpeakerBase. When the Main
Speaker Base module opens, select <i>New Speaker</i> from the <i>File</i> pull
down menu. Then select <i>Case</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu. This
will open a slightly modified version of the Edit Room module. Here you will
construct the loudspeaker Case (wireframe) drawing, just as you would construct
a room.</p>
<p>The difference is that we will be creating a wireframe drawing
using Edges, instead of creating Faces as we have done in our other exer-cises.
We’ll start with a basic rectangular loudspeaker. We'll assume the loudspeaker
is 36&quot; tall, 18&quot; wide and 24&quot; deep (3’ tall, 1.5’ wide and 2’
deep).</p>
<p>We’ll start by inserting a Vertice at 0, 0, 0. Then
Duplicate/Displace it by -2’ in the x field to create the other bottom front
corner. Then use the <i>Insert Edge [e]</i> tool to create the bottom Edge.
After that it’s a simple matter of using Duplicate/Displace to create the other
front and rear Edges. The final step in creating the cabinet is to use the <i>Insert
Edge [e]</i> tool again to add the side edges.</p>
<p>When you are done your drawing will look like this.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Creating a wireframe drawing for a trapezoidal cabinet is almost
as easy. The only problem you may encounter is not knowing the width of the
rear of the cabinet. That doesn’t present a problem if you know the side
angles. For our purposes let’s assume we are working with a 15 degree
trapezoidal cabinet of the same height, width and depth of the previous
cabinet.</p>
<p>Start by inserting the two front corner Vertices (0,0,0, and -2,
0,0). Then select one of the Vertices, P2 for example and open the Mouse menu
and select <i>Duplicate</i>. We’ll be using the Polar capabilities of
Duplicate/Displace to insert the rear Vertices. Insert 2 into the <i>Dist</i>
field (the cabinet is 2 feet deep) and 165 (180 minus 15) into the <i>hor:</i>
field.</p>
<p>Note that as you do this, the program calculates the Cartesian
distances and the y distance ends up being less than 2. We want the cabi-net to
be 2 feet deep, so change y back to 2. Note that as you do this the program
recalculates the Polar dist (the length of the line be-tween the two Vertices).
Click <i>OK</i> to insert the Vertice.</p>
<p><img width=421 height=191
src="E2.files/image116.jpg"></p>
<p>Use the same procedure to insert the other rear Vertice only
change the Polar <i>hor:</i> figure to -165.</p>
<p>Now that the four bottom Vertices are in place it’s a simple
matter to Duplicate/Displace them 3 feet in the z direction tocreate the top
ver-tices. Adding the Edges is a snap with all the Vertices in place.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E2.files/image117.jpg"></p>
<p>The last step is to change the location of the 0, 0, 0 point
from its present location to where the cabinet’s Insertion or Reference
(Rotation) point is located. Most manufacturers use the point they used as the
center of the directivity balloon while they were taking measurements; i.e.,
the point around which they rotated the cabinet. Typically this point is placed
at the rear of the high frequency horn.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>Chapter 5: Cluster Construction</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The 0, 0, 0 point is currently the lower right corner of the
cabinet. Let’s assume we want the Insertion point to be 12” from the top of the
cabinet and 6” from the rear on the center line (x axis).</p>
<p>To do this, go to the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and select <i>Move
Point of Reference</i> to open the dialog box shown below.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember when filling in the x, y, z move
parameters is that you will actually be moving the cabinet and not the
Ref-erence Point. It stays at the same spot and the cabinet moves. The correct
values are shown below.</p>
<p><img width=500 height=524
src="E2.files/image118.jpg"></p>
<p>The final wireframe drawing is shown below. The 0, 0, 0 point is
where the drawing will be inserted into a project.</p>
<p>The last step is to save the Wireframe drawing. First <i>Check
Data[F5]</i>; then close the Edit Case Speaker window and return to the Speaker
module. Answer <i>Yes</i> to the Apply Project Data prompt that appears and
then go to <i>Save Speaker</i> under the <i>File</i> pull down menu or do a <i>Ctrl
+ S </i>to save the file.</p>
<p><b>Creating New Loudspeaker Files</b></p>
<p>It's possible that you may have occasion to add a new
loudspeaker to the Speaker Database either by importing measurement data or by
manually inserting the data.</p>
<p>The details for adding loudspeaker data into the Speaker
Database can be found in the EASE SpeakerBase section of the EASE Manual.</p>
<p>It's Chapter 10. The EASE Manual is stored as a PDF document

<p><b>Chapter 6. Import / Export Capabilities</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The IMEX Import &amp; Export Module included in EASE JR and EASE
allows a wide variety of different file types to be imported into the pro-gram
and most EASE files to be exported in a number of formats.</p>
<p><img width=210 height=237
src="E2.files/image120.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE 2.1, CADP2, ASCII, Google SketchUp and AutoCAD DXF Files
can all be imported, while most EASE 4.3 data files can be exported to other
programs as either Google SketchUp, AutoCAD DXF or ASCII Files, or exported
directly to EASE 3.0. EASE 3.0 Files open automatically in 4.3 and do not need
to be imported.</p>
<p>To open the IMEX Import/Export Module select <i>Import/Expor</i>t
from the <i>File</i> pull down menu in the Main EASE screen. When the IMEX
window opens, open the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu shown here.</p>
<p>Note that if you enter the IMEX module as a “stand alone” module
(without a project loaded) the Export listing will be grayed out.</p>
<p><b>Import EASE 2.1</b></p>
<p>To import existing EASE 2.1 files, select <i>Import EASE 2.1</i>
to open the sub-menu shown here: The first three choices are used to Import old
EASE 2.1 projects into 4.3. The first option, <i>Project / Global Base </i>will
install the EASE 2.1 Loudspeaker and Material database files that<i> </i>are a
part of the EASE 2.1 project file into the EASE40Data Global Speaker and
Material database folders.</p>
<p><img width=204 height=168
src="E2.files/image121.jpg"></p>
<p>The second option, <i>Project / Local Base</i>, will install the
EASE 2.1 Loudspeaker and Material database files along with the project files.
It allows you to keep the old database files separate from the newer database
files.</p>
<p>The third choice, <i>Project Group / Local Base</i> is used to
import a group of 2.1 project files into 4.3. Note that the data files will be
kept separate from the EASE 4.3 database files.</p>
<p>The second set of import choices, <i>Speaker File</i> and <i>Speaker
Folde</i>r, allow existing EASE 2.1 Loudspeaker files to be imported into 4.3.
Speaker File imports a single loudspeaker data file, while Speaker Folder
imports a group of loudspeaker data files. The Speaker File method is
recommended since it provides you with more control over the import routine.
Note that all imported loudspeakers will be marked &quot;Non-Authorized.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Material File </i>and Material<i> Folder </i>perform
the same functions for Wall Materials. In all cases,<i> </i>make your selection
and then follow the Prompts.</p>
<p><b>Export EASE 3.0 Project</b></p>
<p>Export EASE 3.0 Project provides a means of converting and
exporting an EASE 4.3 Project File as an EASE 3.0 Project File. Note that this
option is not available unless a Project has been loaded into the program.</p>
<p>The conversion, however, is not always a perfectly smooth one
and some editing of the 3.0 Project File may have to be done. Also note that
none of the 4.3 Data Files, (Loudspeakers, Wall Materials, etc.) will be
exported. They cannot be converted from 4.3 to 3.0 files. This means the
loudspeaker and materials used in the 4.3 project must exist in the 3.0
Databases as 3.0 files</p>
<p>EASE 4.3 will export the converted Project file as a Packed
(zipped) file. When installing it in 3.0, make sure the Base File Find option
is checked. Then EASE 3.0 will attempt to reassign the 4.3 Wall Material and
Loudspeaker pointers.</p>

<p><b>I</b>mport CADP2 is used to import existing CADP2 Job Data into EASE
4.3. Click on<b> </b><i>Import CADP2</i><b> </b>to<b> </b>open the sub-menu
shown here, then select the file type and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>Note that CADP2 Devices and Absorbers should be imported first,
Array Files next and then the Job File.</p>
<p><img width=152 height=213
src="E2.files/image123.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Import ASCII</b></p>
<p>Import ASCII allows &quot;Comma And Quotes-Delimited&quot; ASCII
Files created by spread sheet programs for Speaker Models, Wall Materials,
Lamps and IR Emitters to be imported into the program. Edges, Faces,
Loudspeakers, Audience Areas and Listener Seats ASCII files created by EASE
3.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 can also be imported.</p>
<p>Select <i>Import ASCII</i>, then make your selection from the
sub-menu shown and follow the Prompts.</p>
<p>Note that the file name extension filter is different for each
item. Examples of properly formatted ASCII files can be viewed by using Windows
Explorer to browse to <i>Program Files/EASE 4.3/EasePath/Exam-ples_ASCII.</i></p>
<p><img width=152 height=170
src="E2.files/image124.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Import ASCII (EASE 2.1)</b></p>
<p>ASCII files generated by EASE 2.1 are formatted differently than
the ones created by EASE 3.0 and EASE 4.3. The Import ASCII (EASE 2.1) option
opens the sub-menu shown here to allow these files to be imported into EASE
4.3.</p>
<p><img width=150 height=158
src="E2.files/image125.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Export ASCII</b></p>
<p>Export ASCII allows EASE 4.3 project files to be exported in
ASCII format for use in other programs such as Word or Excel. Note that this
option will not be available unless you have loaded a project into the program.
Then select <i>Export ASCII</i> and make your choice from the sub-menu shown
below.</p>
<p><b>Import DXF / SKP</b></p>
<p>Import DXF / SKP allows files created by Computer-Aided-Design
(CAD) programs to be imported into the program. See the CAD File Transfer
section that follows for more information.</p>
<p><b>Export DXF</b></p>
<p>Export DXF allows EASE 4.3 project files to be exported in DXF
format for use in AutoCAD. Note that this option will not be available un-less
you have loaded a project into the program. See the CAD File Transfer section
that follows for more information.</p>
<p><b>Export SKP</b></p>
<p>Export SKP allows EASE 4.3 project files to be exported to
Google SketchUp. Note that this option will not be available unless you have
loaded a project into the program. See the CAD File Transfer section that
follows for more information.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E2.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) File Transfer</b></p>
<p>Both EASE and EASE JR have facilities to Import and Export both
DXF and SketchUp files. This means that drawing files can be ex-changed between
EASE/EASE JR and any 3D CAD program that can work with DXF or SketchUp files.</p>
<p>For the following exercises we will assume you will be
exchanging files with AutoCAD 2010 or Google SketchUp 7. It's possible to use
other 3D CAD programs or older versions of AutoCAD or SketchUp in a similar
manner; however there may be differences in procedure. EASE exports files that
are compatible with Google SketchUp 6 and AutoCAD 2000 DXF. Review the
operations manual for your CAD pro-gram if you have any doubts.</p>
<p>The Export process is relatively simple. The first step is to
open the project you want to export. We'll use Theater 1 for this exercise.
There are two ways to do this, using the Main menu or by opening the EASE IMEX
module as a stand-alone module.</p>
<p>If you choose the Main menu method, select <i>Import/Export</i>
from the Main menu bar's <i>File</i> pull down menu after loading the project.
This will open the EASE IMEX Import/Export program module with a blank screen.
Then follow the instructions for exporting DXF or SXP files that follow.</p>
<p>If you choose to run the EASE IMEX module as a stand-alone
module, select <i>Close Project</i> from the <i>Main</i> menu's <i>File</i>
pull down menu, then select <i>Import/Export</i> from the Main menu's <i>File</i>
pull down menu. When the IMEX module opens, select <i>Open Project</i> from the
<i>File</i> pull down menu and browse to <i>Theater 1</i>. Click <i>OK</i>.
Then follow the instructions for exporting DXF or SXP files that follow.</p>
<p><b>Exporting DXF Files from EASE</b></p>
<p>Select <i>Export DXF</i> from the Tools pull down menu. This
will open a window asking you for the name of the file you are creating and
where you want it saved. Enter the requested information and then press <i>Save</i>
to open the Export DXF screen shown below.</p>
<p><img width=336 height=260
src="E2.files/image126.jpg"></p>
<p>The DXF Length Unit section provides a means of rescaling the
model before exporting it. EASE works in Meters (internally it converts Meters
to Inches for non Metric users) and you may want to rescale the drawing before
exporting it. For example, if you are exporting the drawing for use by an
Architect, you may want to rescale the drawing to Inches. Most architects work
in Architectural units (inches con-verted to feet and inches for display
purpose).</p>
<p>The EASE -&gt; DXF section provides two options for the export
of the Face coordinates. Selecting <i>Convert EASE Faces to: 3D PolyFaces</i>
will create entities that can be shaded and rendered in AutoCAD. Because the
faces of the mesh are planar, the mesh will approximate curved surfaces in the
same way that EASE does and will maintain the structure of the EASE Faces and
the exact Vertex coordinates.</p>
<p><i>Convert EASE Faces to: 3D Polyline</i>s will
create entities that will not be rendered in AutoCAD. This option is the best
choice for programs<i> </i>that do not support 3d PolyFaces and will maintain

<p><b>Importing AutoCAD® DXF Files into EASE</b></p>
<p>Importing AutoCAD 3D DXF drawing files into EASE is just as
simple as exporting an EASE model to AutoCAD as a DXF file -- <b>when the</b> <b>AutoCAD
drawing has been properly formatted.</b></p>
<p>Unlike EASE 3.0 which could import only DXF drawing files
created with 3D Faces, EASE 4.3 can import most AutoCAD drawing ele-ments. The
main exceptions are Solids and Regions. Fortunately, they can easily be
converted to elements that can be read by EASE using the XEDGES command in
AutoCAD 2007 and later. In fact, if you have AutoCAD and want to model the room
in AutoCAD and then Export it to EASE, you may want to construct the AutoCAD
model using 3D Solids and then use the XEDGES command before exporting it to a
DXF file that EASE can use.</p>
<p><b>At this point, you may want to take a few minutes to review the
Import-Export-DXF section of the EASE Manual. It contains some very useful
hints. You'll find the DXF section in Chapter 13.</b></p>
<p><b>The EASE Manual is stored as a PDF File under C:/<i>ProgramFiles/EASE4.3/EasePath/EASE43
Manual.</i> Additional information on Importing DXF files can also be found on
the web at <i>olsonsound.com/ease/index.html.</i></b></p>
<p>If you do not have AutoCAD and are working with an Architect who
does, be sure to tell him of the limitations of the Import routine. In fact,
you may want to copy this portion of the Tutorial and the DXF section of the
EASE 4.3 Manual and give it to him as a guide.</p>
<p>Note: EASE like other similar programs cannot convert 2D
drawings into a 3D model. However, 2D drawings exported as DXF files can be
imported into EASE. Some users will import the room's 2D floor plan drawing
into EASE and then use it as the foundation for their 3D EASE model.</p>
<p>To import a file, return to the EASE IMEX Import/Export program
module (select <i>Import/Export</i> from the <i>Main</i> menu bar's <i>File</i>
pull down menu) and select <i>Import DXF/ SKP</i> from the <i>Tool</i>s pull
down menu. This will open a window asking for the name and location of the file
you want to Import.</p>
<p>We might as well use the Theater 1 DXF File we created under
Export DXF. Browse to it and press <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>This will bring up the Import DXF Setup screen shown on the next
page.</p>

<p>We will start by setting the <i>Vertex Snap Cube</i> to 0. This
will bring in all the Vertex coordinates without altering their location. This
is a good way to start, especially if you are importing an unknown model.</p>
<p>We'll accept the default settings for <i>Plane Face Tolerance</i>,
<i>Min. Circle Sectors</i> and <i>Max. Arc-Sector Length</i>. We may want to
change these later after we have had a look at the imported model. The <i>Min.
Circle Segments</i> setting of 8, for example, is fine for importing small
circles but may be too low for any large circles. We won't know until we have
imported the project and looked at it.</p>
<p>We will also leave all the checkboxes unchecked. This will keep
the import time to a minimum. This is a good practice to follow when you are
importing an unknown file. Your first objective is to open the file to see what
you have.</p>
<p>Press <i>OK</i> to close the window and import the DXF File.</p>

<p>Select the <i>Assign from List</i> or <i>Assign from File</i>
button when a row is selected to change the Assigned EASE Material for that
Layer in the imported file.</p>
<p>If you intend to import this project multiple times or will be
importing a number of files that use the same set of Wall Materials then you
should press the <i>Save Map</i> button to create a text-formatted map file
that contains a table of layer names and Wall Material files. You can then use
the <i>Load Map</i> button when importing the subsequent files to assign the

<p>If you
have AutoCAD and had the opportunity to look at the model in AutoCAD, you will
note that the item colors are the same as the colors were in AutoCAD.</p>
<p>Normally
your first step would be to check the dimensions of the model to see if you
used the right scaling for the Import. You'll find the overall dimensions
listed in the upper left corner of the screen. If they appear to be much too
large or too small, you can either import the file again or open the <i>Edit</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Rescale Project</i> to rescale the model's
dimensions.</p>
<p>Next,
look carefully at the drawing. Does it look like you anticipated or do you
suspect that some details or items are missing? If so, who-ever created the DXF
File in AutoCAD, may have turned one or more Layers Off or Frozen them before
creating the DXF File. Try import-ing the File again, only this time check <i>Read
“off”</i> and <i>“frozen” Layers</i> in the <i>Options</i> section of the
Import DXF window. This will &quot;unfreeze&quot; the Frozen Layers and turn
&quot;On&quot; any that were turned &quot;Off&quot;.</p>
<p>Be aware
that some of the Faces/Edges may be difficult to see on small or low resolution
screens because of the lack of contrast between the material colors and the
background color of the IMEX window.. In most cases, the Faces/Edges are there,
you just can’t see them. To verify that they are there Save the file and open
it in Edit Project.</p>
<p>Now,
it's time to save the file as an EASE Project File if you didn't save it
immediately after importing it. If you didn't save it previously, go to the
File pull down menu and select <i>Apply Project Data</i>. This will close the
IMEX Import/Export program module and allow you to save the project in the EASE
Main window.</p>
<p>Note
that the preceding paragraph assumes you followed the Tutorial closely and had
a project open when you entered the IMEX program module. If you opened the IMEX
program module as a stand-alone module (without having first loaded a project)
the Apply Project Data command line won't be available to you. You have to go
to the <i>File</i> pull down menu and select <i>Save As</i> and then manually
close the IMEX Import/Export program module.</p>

<p><b>Some
Hints For Those Who Do Not Have AutoCAD</b></p>
<p>Now,
let's take another look at some of the problems you may encounter when you
Import an unknown file.</p>
<p>Importing
an AutoCAD DXF File of unknown properties when you don't have AutoCAD and can't
look at the drawing or modify it can be a real challenge. Fortunately EASE 4.3
includes a number of tools that can help you.</p>
<p><b>What if
the File doesn't Import? </b>This is a sign that the DXF does not have
any importable elements, or that all layers are frozen or the<b> </b>File
format is wrong. All you can do is to go back to the source of the DXF File and
review with them what you need.</p>
<p><b>What if
you can see a multitude of lines in the drawing, but very few Faces? </b>Try
importing the drawing again, only with the<b> </b><i>Closed</i><b> </b><i>Multiple
Lines to Faces </i>option turned On in the Import DXF Setup window. The import
routine will then create a Face from any set of lines,<i> </i>polylines and
arcs that are planar and when connected end-point to start-point they enclose
an area.</p>
<p><b>What if
the drawing includes a multitude of small Faces? </b>Try the<b>
</b><i>Collect Scattered Faces</i><b> </b>option.<b> </b><i>Collect Scattered
Faces</i><b> </b>will create a<b> </b>single Face from any set of Faces that
are planar and completely fill an area.</p>
<p>When
you select <i>Collect Scattered Faces</i>, two new options will appear, <i>Cut
Intersecting Faces</i> and <i>Overlap Test</i>. <i>Collect Scattered Faces</i>
may produce Faces that intersect (have one Face going through another without
creating an intersection). <i>Cut Intersecting Faces</i> will cut these Faces
into pieces.</p>
<p>Collect
Scattered Faces may also produce Faces that look incomplete. When this happens,
check the <i>Overlap Test</i>. This should solve the problem.</p>
<p><b>What if
Collect Scattered Faces only eliminated a few of the small Faces? </b>Try
rerunning the import routine with a larger<b> </b><i>Plane Face</i><b> </b><i>Tolerance</i>.
This will enable the<i> Collect Scattered Faces </i>option to combine more
Faces.</p>
<p><b>What if
the drawing has a number of Face borders that contain a number of Vertices? </b>Try the<b>
</b><i>Straighten Border of Faces</i><b> </b>option. The<b> </b>import routine
will look for these Vertices and delete any that are on the Face border between
the corner Vertices.</p>
<p><b>What if
the Straighten Border of Face Option only deletes a few of the surplus
Vertices? </b>Try rerunning the import routine with a<b> </b>larger <i>Vertex
Snap Cube</i>.</p>
<p><b>What if
the drawing includes a number of &quot;Outside&quot; Faces? </b>Try the<b>
</b><i>Waste Outside Faces</i><b> </b>option.<b> </b><i>Waste Outside Faces</i><b>
</b>uses a Ray<b> </b>Tracing algorithm to detect inside Faces and mark outside
Faces. Outside Faces are assigned a &quot;Waste&quot; wall material in EASE.
They are then relatively easy to delete using the Project's Face Table.</p>
<p>If
there are a large number of outside Faces and you have AutoCAD, another way to
get rid of them is to Export the project back to Auto-CAD. They will all be
placed on a Waste layer in AutoCAD and can then easily be deleted by deleting
the Layer.</p>
<p>The Ray
Tracing algorithm also detects Two-Fold Faces and corrects the orientation of
Faces that are improperly oriented.</p>
<p>One
word of caution concerning <i>Waste Outside Faces</i>. It uses a so-called
Spy-Point as the source of the Detection Rays. Without Auto-</p>
<p>CAD,
you have no way of knowing where the Spy-Point(s) is (are) located or how many
of them are included. The odds are that the Auto-</p>
<p>CAD
drawing won't have any Spy-Points, but you never know until you have tried it.</p>
<p>If the
AutoCAD drawing doesn't include any Spy-Points, EASE will place a Spy-Point in
the geometric center of the model. Be careful on this one. If you have an L
shaped room or some other strange shape, it's possible the geometric center may
be outside the room.</p>
<p>Selecting
<i>Waste Outside Faces</i> will introduce a sub-menu giving you the opportunity
to set the <i>Detection Order</i> for the Ray Tracing Algo-rithm or to use the <i>Auto</i>
setting. The <i>Auto</i> setting will run the routine until it assumes that all
internal Faces have been found. This can take a long time in models having a
large number of Faces. We suggest starting with a low <i>Detection Order</i>.</p>

<p><b>EASE
4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p><b>What if
only one side of the room imports? </b>Return to the Import DXF window
and check<b> </b><i>Add Symmetrical Entities</i><b> </b>in the Options
sec-tion. The Import routine will then put in the other side of the room as a
mirror image.</p>
<p><b>Can I
import just Edges and not Faces? </b>If the model is very complex,
it may be easier to just import the structure of the model without<b> </b>any
of the planar lines being automatically turned into Faces. In the Import DXF
window check the <i>Only Structure (Faces to Edges)</i> in the Options section.
The Import routine will only import the edges of the surfaces as EASE Edges.
You can then use the coordinates of the Edges to draw your own EASE Faces or
Extrude the edges to create Faces. After you are done creating all the Faces
you can delete all the Edges using the Edge Table.</p>
<p>As soon
as you are satisfied that you have a usable drawing, your first step will
probably be to determine if there are any Holes in the Room. The odds are that
there may be a few as some of the Faces may be incorrectly oriented. This
should be easy to correct using the Find Holes/Fix Holes technique we learned
while building Tutorial 1.</p>
<p>If you
did not assign materials to all the layers using the Assign Wall Material
window then the Color and Material Coupled feature of EASE will simplify the
task of assigning materials based on the color of the surface. Open <i>Tables</i>
under the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu and select <i>Faces</i>. This will open
the Edit Face Table. The<i> Color and Material Coupled </i>command is under the<i>
Tools </i>pull down menu. It enables you to<i> </i>change the material of all
Faces having the same color by changing the material on just one of them. It's
a great time saver if the model has a large number of Faces.</p>
<p>If the
AutoCAD drawing didn't include material colors, the simplest thing to do is
select one of the Faces, then right click to open the Mouse Menu (or use the
Ctrl + F3 key command) to open the <i>Change All Same</i> window and insert the
material used on the highest num-ber of Faces. This will take care of all the
Faces that use that material quickly and reduce the number of Faces you have to
do individually.</p>

<p>One of
the very powerful analysis tools included in both EASE and EASE JR is Optimize
RT.</p>
<p>Our
Theater 1 model is not ideal for music because of its low reverberation times.
It's a bit dry. Optimize RT is a quick and easy way to in-vestigate what can be
done to correct the room acoustics.</p>
<p>Open
the Theater 1 model, go to the Edit Project Data module and select Optimize RT
from the Tools pull down menu to open the Opti-mize RT window shown below.</p>
<p><img
width=397 height=319 src="E3.files/image008.jpg"></p>
<p>The top
graph displays the absorption coefficients of the Material shown in the
Material field to the left of the graph; in this case PLAST/LTHS. The figures
below the Material window tell you how much of the room's surface area is
covered by that material; in this case almost 1/3 of the total surface area.</p>
<p>The
down arrow opens a listing of all the materials used in the room. This allows
you to quickly scan through the materials and their ab-sorption coefficients.
The materials are listed in order based on the percentage of surface area they
cover. Note that in this room only 3 materials cover almost 70% of the room's
surface. If we are going to significantly change the RT times we are probably
going to have to deal with one of these materials (surfaces).</p>
<p>Also
note that this module is an excellent spot to quickly review and compare the
absorption characteristics of a number of materials. All you have to do is to
load them into the project and then you can review them much faster than you
can in the Main Material Base module.</p>
<p>The
bottom graph shows the calculated RT times for the room. Don't be alarmed if
the curve looks a little different than the one shown in Room RT under the View
pull down menu. It's the vertical scaling that makes the difference.</p>
<p>The
Tentative section of the Optimize RT screen allows you to
&quot;tentatively&quot; replace one of the materials with a different material
and view the effect. First, choose the material you want to replace in the
Material window. We’ll choose CINDBLK R which covers 24.27% of the room’s
surface area.</p>

results shown below. The green curves show the changes. It looks like we are
headed in the right di-rection.</p>

<p>Selecting

or the <i>Reverberation Times</i> graphs allows you to change the Absorption
Coefficient or RT Times frequency by frequency. Clicking on <i>Draw</i> lets
you draw a new desired Absorption Coefficient or RT60 curve. To use Pick, click
on a point on the Absorption Coefficient or RT Time curve and then use your
Mouse to move the curve up or down at that frequency. To use Draw, click on a
point and then use your Mouse to &quot;drag&quot; the desired curve across the

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that as you are drawing new curves, if you don't like the one you have drawn
you can erase it by clicking on one of the Set <i>Edit Val-ues </i>buttons.
They act as Reset buttons by restoring the original values.</p>
<p>Also
notice that the program will not let you do the impossible. The absorption of
the PLAST/LTHS surfaces is so small that little can be ac-complished toward
increasing the room's RT60 by substituting a material with a lower absorption
coefficient. So, the program won't let you set an RT60 time curve higher than
the curve you would get if the PLAST/LATHS surfaces were all changed to MIRROR
reflectors having no absorption. It will only let you draw a slightly higher
RT60 time curve. This tells you that if you are going to make the room more
rever-berant, you will have to work on one of the materials covering more
surface area.</p>
<p>At this
point you can either go through the materials (surfaces) one by one until you
find a combination that gives you the desired RT Times or you can enter a
desired RT curve (the Target curve) and use Seek to let the program seek out
from a Pool of surface materials the one which comes closest to producing the
desired result. You can also mark the Target Curve with a Tolerance frame if
you like. Put a check in the Tolerance check box under Target Values and then
press <i>Set Target</i> under <i>Edit Values</i>.</p>
<p>Select <i>Seek</i>
and the program will search the Pool for you and select the best one available
in the Pool. For us, the program's initial selec-tion was WOOD FLR, a material
we weren’t sure we wanted to use for the surfaces involved). So, we redrew the
Target Curve and pressed Seek again to see if the program would come up with
anpother material. See how fast it is to try different solutions.</p>
<p>Note
that at this point the only purpose of Target Values is to visualize the
desired RT and, if wanted a tolerance range. You can also re-turn to Edit
Project and expand the Pool of available Materials. To do this, return to the
Edit Program windowe and go to The Edit pull down menu and select Select
Project DataBase/Select Wall Material to browse through the Material database
and make your selections.</p>
<p><img
width=397 height=319 src="E3.files/image011.jpg"></p>
<p>At this
point the normal thing to do would be to <i>Apply</i> and <i>OK</i> the change
and return to one of the mapping programs to see what effect this change had on
the overall system.</p>
<p>Note
that we could have also opened the Edit Table Tab and entered the desired
Absorption Coefficients or RT Times in the data spread-sheet under Edit Value.</p>
<p>It also
should be noted that this example is a little unique in that usually we are
looking for a way to decrease the RT Times instead of in-creasing them. The
principle is the same, however.</p>

<p>Vision
allows you to enhance the visual aspects of a model by adding light and shadows
to the room and Textures to the surfaces.</p>
<p>Open
Vision 1 (go to <i>File/Open Project</i> and select <i>Vision 1</i> or use the
desktop icons). When the Loading Complete/Draw Room prompt ap-pears answer <i>No</i>;
then select <i>Standard Rendering</i> from the <i>View</i> pull down menu.
We’ll take a look at the model in Standard Rendering be-fore we proceed to the
Vision module.</p>
<p>This
will open the screen shown below. Probably the first thing you will notice is
that a large Face has been placed outside the room. Its purpose will become
clear when we open the Vision module.</p>
<p><img
width=520 height=313 src="E3.files/image013.jpg"></p>
<p>This
would probably be a good time to take a good look at the Room. Click on the
Walker icon and use it to walk around the Room. When you have finished with
your tour, close the Standard Rendering module and return to the Main menu and
select <i>Architectural Ren-dering</i>. This will open the screen shown below.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that except for a few color changes, it looks pretty much the same as the
Standard Rendering version. Vision has 4 rendering modes and opens in the
OpenGL Simple Map mode which doesn’t show reflections, shadows and variations in
color or shade. For a better dis-play, open the <i>Calculations</i> pull down
menu and select <i>OpenGL Texture Map</i>. <i>OK</i> the setup parameters. Be
prepared for the rendering to a minute or two. This model has 899 Faces and the
rendering takes time. You can watch the progress in the <i>Process Tile</i>
readout above the Tool Bars. The same readout area will post the file size as
soon as the rendering is completed.</p>
<p><img
width=520 height=313 src="E3.files/image015.jpg"></p>
<p>The
first thing you’ll probably notice is that the large Face outside the model is
a Mountain scene. It’s purpose is to add realism to the model by allowing you
to look out the windows while inside the model and see the scenery outside.
We’ll do that later.</p>
<p>You
probably also noticed the model is dark. The reason is that the lights are not
turned on. In Vision, as in real life, you need light to see. Click on the <i>Bulb</i>
icon and when the Bulb listing appears turn on all the lights (right click on <i>OK</i>
to select all the items and then left click to <i>OK </i>the selection.)<i> OK </i>the
Recalculate prompt and the Calculation Setup Parameters when they appear.</p>
<p>You’ll
notice a big difference when the rendering is completed.</p>

<p>Both
the OpenGL Simple Map and OpenGL Texture Map rendering modes allow you to move around
the model. Select the <i>Walker</i> Icon or just click on the model to open the
Walker and take a walk around the room. The Eye Icon in the Walker window gives
you a choice of Or-thographic or Perspective views.</p>
<p>You
should also try using the Turn feature. Select the <i>Turn</i> icon. Then hold
down the left mouse button to turn right or left or up and down, and the right
mouse button to move forward, backward, right and left in the room. It’s a
quick and easy way to move around the model once you get the feel for it.</p>
<p><img
width=520 height=313 src="E3.files/image017.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice
that the rendering is blurred and jagged in some areas. This is primarily a
matter of resolution. To go to a higher resolution render-ing, go to the <i>Calculations</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Scanline</i>. Notice how the rendering improves
(see below.)</p>
<p><img
width=522 height=323 src="E3.files/image018.jpg"></p>
<p>Raytracing,
the 4th rendering mode produces an even higher-resolution, photo-realistic
rendering. If you have the time, try it out. You’ll see another big change. One
word of caution, neither Scanline or Raytracing rendering modes allow you to
use the Walker to move around the room.</p>

<p><b>Using
Vision</b></p>
<p>Now,
it’s time to use Vision. Close the Vision 1 model and open the Model_2 project
we worked with earlier.</p>
<p>As we
learned earlier, Vision requires light. Accordingly, our first step will be to
add Lamps to the Model-2 project. To start, we'll put in a row of Lamps 3 feet
below the ceiling peak on 15 foot centers starting at the rear wall.</p>
<p>Open
the Edit Project module and click on the <i>Insert Lamp</i> icon (the light
bulb icon). When the Lamp Properties sheet opens, correct the X,Y, Z
coordinates to 0, -67, 22 and set the Intensity to 30. The default Intensity of
0.0 isn't very bright.</p>
<p><img
width=385 height=343 src="E3.files/image019.jpg"></p>
<p>Next,
use the right mouse button to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Duplicate</i>.
When the Displacement window opens, insert 15 in the y field and 4 into the <i>Repeated</i>
field. Press <i>OK</i>. It's that easy to add a row of lights.</p>

<p><b>EASE

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Next
use the <i>F6</i> function key to <i>Apply and Save</i> the changes and then go
to the <i>View</i> pull down menu and select <i>Architectural Rendering</i> to
open the Vision module.</p>
<p>The
initial image will be dark because Vision has not had the opportunity to render
the model. Vision offers four rendering methods.</p>
<p><b>OpenGL
Simple Map </b>is the fastest, but does not include Textures in the image it
produces.</p>
<p><b>OpenGL
Texture Map </b>takes longer but does include Textures.</p>
<p><b>Scanline
</b>produces higher resolution images than either of the two OpenGL
methods, but usually takes longer to produce the image.</p>
<p><b>Raytracing
</b>produces the highest quality images, but requires longer
calculation times.</p>
<p>Both
OpenGL methods allow you to move around in the model. Scanline and Raytracing
do not. As a result most users use one of the OpenGL methods during the initial
setups (adjusting the lights and applying Textures) and then switch to either
the Scanline or Raytracing method after they are satisfied with the model and
have the view they want to save.</p>
<p>Before
we render the model, we need to make sure the Lamps are turned on. Click on the
<i>Lamps</i> icon in the tool bar. When the Lamps list-ing appears select all
of the Lamps to turn them On. Remember a right click on <i>OK</i> will select
all the Lamps and a left click on <i>OK</i> will then register the selection.</p>
<p>Now, go
to the <i>Calculation</i> pull down menu and select either the Scanline or the
OpenGL Texture Map rendering method.</p>
<p>The
image below was made with Scanline.</p>
<p><img
width=524 height=323 src="E3.files/image021.jpg"></p>
<p>Obviously,
we have a hot spot on the front wall. The default Lamp is a sphere and is
throwing more light on the front wall because it is closer to it than it is to
the floor. We could correct this by moving it, by changing to a more
directional Lamp or by reducing its intensity. For now, lets just change its
intensity. Return to Edit Project, select the Lamp at the front of the room
(it’s L5) and reduce its Intensity to 10. <i>Check Data[5] </i>and return to
Vision. Select<i> Acquire Project Data [Ctrl + O</i>] and use Scanline (under
Calculations) to redraw the graphic.<i> </i>You’ll see the hot spot is greatly
reduced. For now, accept the lighting setup. We can always come back to it at a
later time.</p>
<p>Vision
allows you to apply Textures to all surfaces. One of the attributes that can be
assigned to Textures is Transparency. To illustrate this, we'll turn the
windows transparent so we can look through them and see the outside landscape.
Return to <i>Edit Project</i>, Pick one of the win-dows and then right click to
open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Properties</i>.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>Chapter
8: Vision</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>When
the Properties window opens, select the <i>Textures</i> Tab. This will open the
screen shown below. Use the <i>[.]</i> button to change the de-fault Wall
Texture to <i>glass_10_medium.tex</i>, a transparent Texture. Note that the
procedure is the same as the one we've been using to change Wall Materials and
Loudspeakers.</p>
<p><img
width=263 height=273 src="E3.files/image022.jpg"></p>
<p>You
will also notice a Copy To button. This button allows you to copy this Face's
Texture to other Faces. It makes it easy to assign Textures to a number of
Faces. Try it out by copying this Texture to the other windows. Click on <i>Copy
To</i> and follow the prompts to select the other Window Faces. You’ll need to
know the Labels of the other window Faces, but its fast and easy.</p>
<p>Now,
let's check to make sure the windows are truly transparent. Check Data [F5] and
then reopen the Vision window. At this point, Vision doesn't have the changes
we made in Edit Project. Go to the <i>File</i> pull down menu and click on <i>Acquire
Project Data</i> or use the <i>Ctrl + O</i> key command. Then use Scanline to
refresh the window.</p>
<p><img
width=524 height=323 src="E3.files/image023.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice
that the color of the windows has changed. The only problem is that we are
looking out the window at the background color of the screen. We need to add a
landscape to look at. Adding one is easy to do. The first step is to create a
large Face outside the room model. It's exact size is relatively unimportant.
All we want is for it to be large enough that we'll be seeing it no matter what
angle we look out the window.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>EASE
4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Before
we add this external Face we need to do two things. So far, we have been
modeling in the Symmetrical modeling mode. Since we will be adding only one
Face, we need to change to the non-symmetrical mode. We will also be placing
the Face outside a Closed room and EASE doesn’t like that and will view the new
Face as a Hole in the model. As a result, it won’t let you Check Data until the
Hole is elim-inated. The simple solution to this is to turn the model into an
Open room.</p>
<p>Return
to Edit Project, right click on the screen and select <i>Room Data</i> from the
Mouse Menu that pops up. Then put a check in the <i>Room</i> <i>Open </i>box
and uncheck the<i> Room Symmetric </i>box.</p>
<p>For
practice, let's try a method of adding a Face that we haven't used before, the
Insert Rectangle tool. Switch to the <i>Side [x]</i> view and then click on the
<i>Insert Rectangle</i> iconl. Use the Mouse cursor to place the upper left
corner of the Face where you want it, and then move the Cursor to the lower
right corner and click. It's that simple.</p>
<p>EASE
probably placed the Face at x = 0. We want it at x = -50, so use the Mouse Menu
to <i>Displace</i> the Face by -50. This places it 25 feet away from the
outside of the room. The Face we created is inverted (we are looking at the
reflective side) and we want the reflective side facing the room. Use the <i>Invert</i>
tool to correct this.</p>
<p>Another
way to have added this Face would have been to use the Mouse Menu to change the
yz Editing Plane to -50. Then, the Face would have been added at x = -50 and we
wouldn't have had to move it. To try this out, use the <i>Undo Tool</i> to
remove the Face we just added; then use the Mouse Menu to select the <i>yz-Plane
Value</i>. Enter -50 in the <i>Plane Value</i> field. Now, use Insert Rectangle
again. You'll see the Face was placed at x = -50. EASE has a wide variety of
tools to speed up the modeling process.</p>
<p>The
next step is to add a Texture (Mountain landscape) to this Face. Use the Mouse
Menu to open the Properties folder and then select the Textures Tab. Click on
the <i>Change [.]</i> button and select <i>Mountain_ill_2</i> and <i>OK</i>.
You'll find it stored in the Texture File under the Vision project in
Projects40. The scene will probably appear in the viewing window as a number of
blue lines. This is because the scene isn't sized to the Face. There are two
ways to do this, graphically with the cursor or exactly by using the Texture
Reference Point Fields.</p>
<p><img
width=331 height=343 src="E3.files/image024.jpg"></p>
<p>For our
purposes, the graphic method will be fine. Note that the Field under Texture
Reference Points reads Lower Left. Use the mouse cursor (wand) to set the lower
left corner location by clicking on the lower left corner of the Face in the
graphics window. A pleasant tone signal will tell you the corner has been
placed. Then click on &lt;&lt; to switch to the Upper Left corner and set its
location with the mouse cur-sor. Then repeat the operation to set the Lower
Right corner. When you are done, your screen should look like the one shown.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>Chapter
8: Vision</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>If we
had wanted to be exact, we would have selected <i>Select Point</i>. This would
have opened a listing of the Face Vertices. Selecting the correct Vertex, the
lower left corner Vertex, for example, would then have placed the lower left
corner of the mountain scene in the same location as the Face's lower left
Vertex.</p>
<p>Now
approve the changes you have made in the Properties folder by clicking on <i>OK</i>,
<i>Check Data [F5]</i> and return to the Vision Module.</p>
<p>First,
go to the <i>File</i> pull down menu and click on <i>Acquire Project Data</i>.
Then, go to the <i>Calculations</i> pull down menu and select <i>Scanline</i>.</p>
<p>As you
can see from the screen shown below, the mountain scene is in place.</p>
<p><img
width=522 height=323 src="E3.files/image025.jpg"></p>
<p>This
would be a good time to take a walk around the Room and verify that we can look
out the windows and see the mountain. Either se-lect the Walker and take a
walking tour or sit down in one of the Listener Seats (select the <i>View</i>
pull down menu and then <i>Perspective/Lis-tener</i>) and look out the windows.</p>
<p><img
width=509 height=316 src="E3.files/image026.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that if you rendered the Room in Scanline, you will have to render the room
again after you have settled upon your viewing location.</p>
<p>To
avoid having to do this repeatedly, select <i>OpenGL Texture Map</i>. Then,
you'll only have to render the Room once.</p>

<p>Now
that we have verified that we can see out the windows, lets see if they are
truly transparent and will allow light (sunlight) to enter the Room from the
outside. Return to the Edit Project module and select the <i>Insert Lamp</i>
tool and click on a spot between the Room and the Face we added outside the
Room. When the Properties screen appears, place the Lamp at -45, -40, 25.</p>
<p>Since
we want to shine our light into the Room to simulate sunlight, let's choose a
more directional Lamp than a Sphere. Click on the <i>Change [.] </i>button
and then select the<i> Parallel_Yel.New </i>Lamp. Increase the Lamp Intensity,
too, from 30 to100. Next approve the setup<i> </i>parameters by clicking on <i>OK</i>.
Then use the right mouse button to open the Mouse Menu and select <i>Lamp
Aiming</i>. Aim the Lamp at one of the windows.</p>
<p><i>Check

down menu to<i> Acquire Project Data </i>or the<i> Ctrl + 0 </i>key command to<i>
</i>update the Vision module. Click on the <i>Lamp</i> icon and turn the new
Lamp On. Then render the Room to see the sunshine shining on the floor.Creating
A New Light Source</p>
<p><img
width=522 height=317 src="E3.files/image027.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Creating
New Lamps (Light Sources)</b></p>
<p>As we
found out earlier, Vision will not operate properly without lights. The Light
Sources (Lamps) are inserted into the model during the modeling process using
the Room Editor.</p>
<p>A few
Lamps are included in the Light Source library supplied with the program, but
you will probably want to create additional Lamps.</p>
<p>This is
easy to do using the Light Source Editor. Let's try it out.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Open
the Light Source Editor by going to <i>Main Databases</i> under the <i>File</i>
pull down menu in EASE Main and selecting <i>Light Sources</i>.</p>
<p>The
opening Light Source Editor window is shown on the next page.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Select <i>New</i>
from the <i>File</i> pull down menu and choose a name (Label) for the light
source that you want to create. Be creative in as-signing a name (Label) to the
new Light Source. You want to be able to easily identify it.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Enter
the name of the Manufacturer if you want to use a certain product.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>Chapter
8: Vision</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>If you
want to use a color other than white, click on the <i>Color</i> field or the <i>Change
[···]</i> button next to it.. A color palette will pop up giv-ing you the
opportunity to choose an appropriate color for the light source.</p>
<p>Step 5:</p>
<p>The
next step is to choose the type of light. You can choose between a Point Source
with a defined opening angle (Aperture) and a Source of Parallel Light. If you
want to simulate natural light (sun light) illuminating a space, choose the Parallel
Light option. Other-wise, use Point Source and define the opening angle.</p>
<p>Step 6:</p>
<p>When
you are satisfied with the parameters, save the light source by doing a <i>Ctrl
+ s</i> and then reviewing and approving the name and destination Prompt that
appears.</p>
<p><img
width=211 height=278 src="E3.files/image028.jpg"></p>
<p>Let's
try it out by creating a new pale yellow Point Source with a 120 degree opening
angle. We’ll call it <i>LiteYel120</i>.</p>
<p><img
width=213 height=278 src="E3.files/image029.jpg"></p>
<p>Remember
that in our earlier rendering of this Room we noted hot spots on the front and
rear walls and speculated that changing from the Sphere light to a directional
light would eliminate these. Let’s see if our new Lamp works and better than
the Sphere Lamp.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>EASE
4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>The
first thing we will need to do is to reaim the light. EASE aims lamps in the
same fashion it aims loudspeakers; in other words it aims them down the y axis.
We need to aim them stright down at the floor. Return to Edit Project and open
each Lamps Properties folder, change to the LiteYel120 lamp and insert 90 in
the <i>ver</i> field under View Angle. Another way to accomplish this change
would be to select a Lamp and use the Mouse meno <i>Change All Same</i> command
to change all the Lamps to Liteyel120. You could also use <i>Lamp Aiming</i> in
the Mouse menu to individually reaim each Lamp.</p>
<p>Make
the changes<i>, Check Data [F5]</i> and then return to the Vision Module. Use
the <i>File</i> pull down menu to <i>Acquire Project Data</i> or the <i>Ctrl</i></p>
<p>+ <i>0 </i>key command to update the Vision module. Click on
the<i> Lamp </i>icon and turn On all the Lamps. Then render the Room.</p>
<p><img
width=522 height=314 src="E3.files/image030.jpg"></p>
<p>As you
can see from the rendering above, the lighting is better than it was, but still
not perfect.</p>
<p>Working
with lights takes a little practice. But, it's worth it. As any good
photographer will tell you, one of the secrets to great photos is the lighting.
It just takes practice and you'll have to spend some time practicing if you are
going to create photo realistic images.</p>
<p>Fortunately,
in EASE it doesn't take long to create new Light Sources, place them in the
model and view the results. Take some time right now and experiment by creating
several new Light Sources and inserting them into the model. We used an
Aperture opening of 180 and it worked much better.</p>
<p>Try
turning off some of the lights to see what difference that makes. Try varying
the Intensity of the lights. Remember, you do this under Edit Project in each
Lamps Properties Folder.</p>
<p><b>Creating
A New Texture</b></p>
<p>Textures
add further realism to your models by enabling you to take surface properties
such as transparency, roughness and reflection characteristics into account in
your renderings. Textures are assigned to Faces in the Edit Project mode by
opening the Faces Properties Folder and selecting the Textures Tab.</p>
<p>The
Texture Editor Module allows you to create any new Textures needed for specific
projects. Let's see how it works.</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Open
the Texture Editor by going to <i>Main Databases</i> under the <i>File</i> pull
down menu in EASE Main and selecting T<i>extures</i>.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Choose <i>New</i>
from the <i>File</i> pull down menu and write the name of the new Texture into
the <i>Label</i> field. Let's use GreyBrick as the name.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>Chapter
8: Vision</b></p>
<p><img
width=672 height=313 src="E3.files/image031.jpg"></p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Enter
any descriptive notes you want to record in the Description field.</p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>Now
that these housekeeping details have been handled, we can start to assign
properties to this Texture, such as transparency, dif-fusion and reflection.
Your choices will depend on the material.</p>
<p>The
properties of every texture are based on characteristics that are defined on
different Layers. Note the Layer chart in the Texture Editor window shown
above. The six basic characteristics are:</p>
<p>- Diffuse Layer</p>
<p>- Reflection Layer</p>
<p>- Transparency layer</p>
<p>- Specular Layer</p>
<p>- Self Illumination</p>
<p>- Bump Map</p>
<p>The
first three parameters (characteristics) are the most important since they
represent the basic properties of a material. Every mate-rial Diffuses a
certain amount of light and Reflects another amount. Some materials, such as
glass are also Transparent. The sum In-tensity of these three primary
characteristics should be 1.</p>
<p>For
example, if you have a surface such as a mirror, you would want it to reflect
100% of the incident light. Accordingly, activate the Reflection Layer and
enter 1 into the Intensity field. At the same time, you should adjust the value
of the Diffuse and Transparency Layers to 0, because the three numbers together
should add up to 1.</p>
<p>If you
want to create a texture representing the properties of a window, you, first of
all, should define the degree of transparency. Let’s say, a window transmits
70% of incident light. Activate the Transparency Layer and enter 0.7 into the
Intensity field. After doing that, it's safe to assume that 30% of the light is
reflected. Accordingly, you would enter 0.3 into the Intensity field of the
Reflection Layer and 0 into the Intensity field of the Diffusion Layer.</p>
<p>The
other 3 layers, Specular, Self Illumination and Bump, further define the
material’s characteristics and how they appear in the ren-derings. Specular
defines the amount of light reflected in a specular way. The higher the value,
the more the surface will shine.</p>
<p>Self
Illumination defines the amount of light emitted into the Room. The higher the
value, the more fluorescent the material.</p>
<p>Bump is
used for rough surfaces, such as tapestry and coarse carpets.</p>
<p>Note
that you may be able to notice the effects of Specular, Self-Illumination and
Bump only in high resolution renderings made with Ray-tracing</p>

the Color column in the Layer chart. It allows you to assign colors to the
material. Just click in the Color field and then use the pop up color chart to
choose the color you want.</p>
<p>Another
essential aspect to the Texture Editor is that you can import images into the
different layers as Texture Maps. This enables you to create brick walls, tile
floors and outside views, etc. and produce outstanding photo realistic images.
See below.</p>
<p><img
width=518 height=344 src="E3.files/image032.jpg"></p>
<p>The
file format of the image needs to be either a .bmp or .tga and they must have
24 or 32 Bits per pixel resolution and be appropriately formatted. Not all .tga
and .bmp files will import successfully.</p>
<p>Let’s
assume the end walls in our model are red brick. How can we do that? First of
all, you need to find an appropriate image and save it as a .bmp or .tga.</p>
<p>There
are a number of possible sources for suitable images. If you have AutoCAD or
have access to AutoCAD through a friend or business associate, you will find
that AutoCAD includes an extensive Texture file base. Use Windows Explorer to
open the AutoCAD folder stored under Program Files and then locate and open the
Textures folder. You will note that these images are stored as .tga files.</p>
<p>EASE
also includes a Graphics Converter that will convert most .tga files that don't
want to import successfully to a usable file. Return to the Main Menu and open
the <i>Tools</i> folder in the EASE Directory Tree. Then, select the <i>Graphics
Viewer/Converter</i> icon. This will open the IrfanView module. Opening a .tga
file in InfanView and then saving it, will convert the .tga file into a .tga
that can be used in the Texture Ed-itor.</p>
<p>Another
source of images is the Web. Go to the Web and insert Clip Art into the Search
window. You will find a long list of sites offering clip art, including some
that offer images at no charge. Another possibility is scanning a photograph.
All ways will work. All you have to remem-ber is that the image needs to be
saved in a high resolution 24 or 32 bit format as a .bmp or .tga.</p>
<p>To make
things easier for you, we stored a GreyBrick.bmp file in the EASE40 Texture
Base folder.</p>
<p>Press
the <i>Add</i> button in the Texture Editor window and <i>Browse</i> to <i>Ease40Data/Textures40/TexturesBase</i>
and double click on the <i>Grey-Brick.bmp </i>icon. Note that in the selection
window you may have to change the<i> Files of Type </i>from<i> EASE Texture
(*.tex) </i>to<i> All Files (**) </i>to<i> </i>see the GreyBrick.bmp file.</p>
<p><i>OK </i>the
prompts that pop up as the program loads the image file. Note that a brick
image now appears in the preview window.</p>

<p><img
width=672 height=323 src="E3.files/image033.jpg"></p>
<p>When
Vision imports images, it will either expand the image to fill the selected
Face area or will repeat the image again and again until the Face is completely
covered. The Width and Height fields allow you to adjust the rendering size of
the image in case the default size is ei-ther to large or to small.</p>
<p>We want
the image to repeat and fill the selected Face area, so make sure Repeated is
checked. The 3.28. default size is not correct; bricks are roughly 4 times as
long as they are thick.. A brick wall four bricks long and 6 bricks high is
more like 36&quot; (3 Ft.) long and 18&quot; (1.5 Ft.) high, so enter 3.0 for
the Width and 1.5 for the Height.</p>
<p>Note
the <i>More.</i> button. Pressing it will reveal more parameters that can be
changed. See the result of pressing this button below.</p>
<p><img
width=395 height=295 src="E3.files/image034.jpg"></p>
<p>As you
can see, the Texture Editor even allows you to Modify the color of the Bitmap.
Just click in the <i>Color Modifier</i> field or press the <i>[.]</i> button
and select the color you want. Let’s Choose a dark red. You will not be able to
see the change in the preview window. The modifica-tion takes place in the
Vision module while the image is being rendered.</p>
<p>Once
you are satisfied with the parameters you have established for the new Texture,
Save it and then close the Texture Editor.</p>

<p><b>Assigning
Textures To The Model</b></p>
<p>Now
that we have created a new GreyBrick Texture, lets try it out.</p>
<p>Reopen
the Model 2 project in the Edit Program mode, select one of the front walls and
open its Properties folder. Then select the <i>Textures</i> tab. The window
will open with Wall, the default Texture selected and appearing in the preview
window. Click on the <i>Change [.]</i> button to open the Select Texture
screen, Browse to the Texture database, add <i>GreyBrick</i> to the project and
select it. <i>OK</i> the change and the pre-view window will change to the
GreyBrick image.</p>
<p><img
width=431 height=444 src="E3.files/image035.jpg"></p>
<p>You
will recall that when we inserted the Mountain scene, we needed to place three
corners of the image in the Preview window, either by using the cursor to place
them or the Select Point method. This is necessary when the image needs to be
expanded to fill the area se-lected. In this case, the GreyBrick image will be
repeated until the Face is filled, so all you need to do is to place one corner
of the image and approve the selection by clicking on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Before
we do, lets look at several other aspects of this window. Note that the Texture
can be applied to either the Face or to the Rear or both and that different
Textures can be applied to the Face and to the Rear.</p>
<p>You
will also see <i>Copy To</i> and Acquire <i>From</i> buttons. To fully utilize
the potential of Vision, Textures should be applied to all Faces. The <i>Copy
To </i>and<i> Acquire From </i>buttons make it easy to do this. Clicking on<i>
Copy To </i>will open a listing of all the Faces, so you can quickly se-lect
all the Faces having similar characteristics and copy this Face's Texture to
them. <i>Acquire From</i> lets you acquire a Texture from an-other Face. Both
can save you a lot of time when you start applying Textures to all the Faces in
a model.</p>
<p>Now,
click on <i>OK</i>, if you haven't already, to approve the changes you made in
the Properties folder and <i>Check Data [F5]</i>.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>Chapter

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Then
open the Vision Module, if it isn't already open, by selecting <i>Architectural
Rendering</i> from the <i>View</i> pull down menu in the EASE Main screen. Note
that if Vision was already open, you will need to go to the <i>File</i> pull
down menu and click on <i>Acquire Data</i>. You need to update the Vision
Module with the changes made under Edit Room.</p>
<p>Make
sure the Lights are turned On (click on the Lamp icon and select all the lamps
from the pop up menu that appears) and then use ei-ther the Walker or the Turn
Icon to get a good view of the front wall.When you have the view you want, go
to the Calculations pull down menu and render the model. As you can see from
the screen shown below, you now have an attractive dark red brick wall to look
at.</p>
<p><img
width=594 height=674 src="E3.files/image036.jpg"></p>
<p>Before
we leave the Vision program module, let’s take a look at the Options folder for
Vision, specifi-cally the Items Tab. Either select <i>Options</i> from the <i>File
</i>pull down menu or use the<i> F9 </i>key command to<i> </i>open the Options
folder and then click on the <i>Items</i> tab.</p>
<p>Notice
that by using the Options folder we could have installed a Default Lamp into
our model without going to the Edit Project Module and inserting a Lamp.</p>
<p>The
Options folder also allows you to increase the intensity of all the Lamps
installed in the Model just by filling in the amount of increase desired.</p>
<p>Both of
these features can be helpful at times.</p>
<p>By now
you must realize that Vision is a very sophisticated program. Additional
details and operating hints for Vision are available in the EASE 43 Manual
stored under Program Files/EASE 4.3/Easepath. Look for Chapter 6.</p>

<p><b>Chapter
9. Room Investigations</b></p>
<p>Now it
is time to investigate the many ways EASE and EASE JR offer to simulate and
display the acoustical and electro-acoustical per-formance of the room and its
loudspeaker system.</p>
<p>In this
section, we will cover all the investigations that are available to both EASE
and EASE JR users. In the next section, Advanced Acoustical Investigations,
we’ll take up the investigations available only to EASE users.</p>
<p><b>New
Mapping Conventions</b></p>
<p>Before
we go on let’s explore several of EASE 4.3’s significant improvements.</p>
<p>EASE
and EASE JR 4.3 now offer a choice of Mapping Conventions. Previous ver-sions
used a Multi-Tone excitation signal for the simulations; all power was inserted
in all frequency bands. In this method the excitation signal is comparable to a
den-sity signal with a W<u>hite Noise spectrum.</u></p>
<p><img
width=249 height=292 src="E3.files/image038.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE
4.3 introduces a Broadband Pink Noise excitation signal and sums the results
according to RTA conventions, a technique commonly employed by RTA ‘s using a
Pink Noise signal.</p>
<p>A
detailed discussion of these two methods is beyond the scope of this Tutorial.</p>
<p>The use
of Broadband Pink Noise also enables EASE to offer accurate A-Weighted response
curves.</p>
<p>The
default method for all new projects is the Broadband Pink Noise method.
Proj-ects created in earlier versions of EASE will open using the Multi-Tone
method. These projects mapping method can be switched to Broadband Pink Noise
in the Settings tab of the Room Data folder shown here.</p>
<p>To
access the Settings tab,either select <i>Room Info/ Data</i> from the Main <i>View</i>
pull down menu or right click on the screen in Edit Project and select <i>Room
Data</i> from the Mouse menu.</p>
<p><b>New
Level Conventions</b></p>
<p>The
change in Mapping Conventions also dictated a change in the Loudspeaker Level
Conventions to accommodate the Pink Noise signal.</p>
<p>Projects
created in earlier versions of EASE will open in 4.3 with the earlier
multi-tone Mapping settings. Projects created in 4.3 will open with the Mapping
Convention set to Broadband Pink Noise .</p>
<p>Note:If
you open an older project and switch to the Broad band Pink Noise mapping
method and enter either Area Mapping or Room Mapping, a prompt will ask you to
Check Data first. When you attempt to Check Data, a second prompt will inform
you that the loudspeaker power setting exceeds the maxi-mum power allowable for
Pink Noise Mapping. You will need to open Edit Project, select one of the
project’s loudspeakers, open its Properties folder and change its power level
settings.</p>
<p><img
width=161 height=105 src="E3.files/image039.jpg"></p>
<p>All the
Ele Power figures will be shown in red as an indication they are set to high;
see example on the next page. The easiest and recommended way to set the levels
to ones accept-able for Pink Noise Mapping is to press the <i>Flat Max</i>
button in the Level section.</p>
<p><img
width=266 height=109 src="E3.files/image040.jpg"></p>
<p>If the
project has more than one loudspeaker the Loudspeaker Power Exceeds Maximum
Power prompt will again appear; clicking <i>OK</i> will highlight a second
loudspeaker and open its Properties folder. Again select <i>Flat Ma</i>x and <i>OK</i>.
Ease will continue to step through the loudspeakers until all the power levels
have been adjusted to the Pink Noise level convention.. It really goes quite
fast.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=310 src="E3.files/image041.jpg"></p>
<p><b>New STI
Intelligibility Calculations</b></p>
<p>EASE
and EASE JR now calculate STI using the MTI (Modulation Tranfer Index) values
in accordance with the current IEC16 Standard IEC60268-16:2003. ALcons and
RaSTI intelligibility figures are then derived from the STI figures.</p>
<p>This
method allows EASE and EASE JR to caculate STI, ALcons and RaSTI
intelligibility projections in both open areas and closed spaces..</p>
<p><b>Area
Mapping</b></p>
<p>For the
first part of this exercise we will study Area Mapping using the Theater 1
example. Room Mapping will be covered later.</p>
<p><img
width=249 height=292 src="E3.files/image042.jpg"></p>
<p>Open
EASE, if it isn't already open, and either select <i>Open Project</i> from the <i>File</i>
pull down menu or use the desk top icons to find and select <i>Theater 1</i>.
When the Draw Room prompt appears answer <i>No</i>, unless you want to
reacquaint yourself with the room model. You do not need to Draw the room at
this time, Instead, you can go direct to the <i>Calculations</i> pull down menu
and select <i>Area Mapping</i>.</p>
<p>Before
we go on let’s check the default settings for the Mapping functions. They are
found in the Edit Data folder.</p>
<p>Either
select <i>Room Info/ Data</i> from the Main <i>View</i> pull down menu or right
click on the screen in Edit Project and select <i>Room Data</i> from the Mouse
menu.</p>
<p>The
Settings tab contains the radio buttons that allow you to select either
Broad-band Pink Noise or Multi-Tone excitation signal. Broadband Pink Noise is
recom-mended. The Settings tab also includes controls for the size of the
Loudspeaker Symbol used in Edit Project and for the programs Tolerance for
Plane Faces. We suggest using the default settings for these controls.</p>

<p><img
width=666 height=314 src="E3.files/image043.jpg"></p>
<p>Let’s
check out the Mapping and Noise tabs next. Click on the <i>Mapping</i> tab.</p>
<p>The <i>Split
Time [ms]</i> setting determines which reflections are considered di-rect sound
during the calculations and which ones are reverberant sound. Since the D/R
(Direct Sound / Reverberant Sound) ratio is a key factor in de-termining
intelligibility and in evaluating other aspects of the system's per-formance
this is an important setting.</p>
<p>Early
reflections, those arriving within 15 to 40 msec of the direct sound, im-prove
intelligibility while reflections arriving later detract from intelligibility.
We suggest 35 msec as a good compromise between the 15 msec figure fa-vored by
some acousticians and the 40 ms favored by others. Change the setting from 10
to 35.</p>
<p><i>Map
With Shadow </i>introduces the effects of any shadowing into the simula-tion. In
the Theater1 model, for example, the effects of the shadowing caused by the
balcony are visible only if Shadowing is turned On. Since simulations run
without shadowing are misleading if there are obstructions in the room, many
users automatically turn Shadowing On all the time.</p>
<p><img
width=249 height=292 src="E3.files/image044.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Interference</i>
section establishes how the energy levels are calculated. When <i>Interference
Sum</i> is not checked, the energy levels are calculated by simple energy
addition of the direct sound from one or more loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Mathematically,
this translates into a &quot;sum of the squares&quot; calculation where the
contribution from a source is first squared and then added to the squared
contributions from other sources. All phase information is lost in the process.</p>
<p>Turning
<i>Interference Sum</i> On by placing a check in the box reverses the
mathematical operation and all source contributions are added first in a
complex manner and then the resulting complex sum squared. This retains all the
phase effects such as cancellations and additions. Run a Direct Sound
simulation with both Interference Sum settings and you'll see a vast
difference. Note that after you have changed the settings, you need to rerun
the simulation to actually see the results.</p>
<p>The <i>Pot.
Energy</i> and <i>Kin. Energy</i> options allows the calculations to be run
using only the pressure part (potential) of the energy or the velocity
(kinetic) part or both parts when both are checked. A thorough explanation of
this as-pect of the program is beyond the scope of this manual. Our
recommenda-tion is to use <i>Interference Sum</i> and the <i>1/3rd Octave</i>
bandwidth.</p>
<p><img
width=249 height=292 src="E3.files/image045.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Noise</i>
tab allows you to set the default noise levels for the project. Note how easy
it is to raise or lower individual frequency levels or all levels
simul-taneously by using the <i>Level</i> buttons.</p>
<p>The <i>Load
File</i> icon allows you to import measured noise data if it is available and
use it in the simulations. You can also <i>Save</i> the noise data file and
then use it at a later date in another project.</p>

reviewed the Room RT tab earlier while constructing our Model_1 Room. If you
skipped that portion of the tutorial, return to page 62 to review it.</p>

<p>Now it’s
time to open the Area Mapping window. Return to the <i>Main</i> window and
select <i>Area Mapping</i> from the <i>Calculations</i> pull dopwn menu.</p>
<p><img
width=411 height=296 src="E3.files/image046.jpg"></p>
<p>it’s
possible your screen may not show the Audience Area names. If it does not, go
to the <i>Items</i> pull down menu and turn on <i>Audience</i> <i>Area Labels </i>or
use the Tool Bar icon to turn them On. Note that the four Audience Areas are
not simply labeled A1, A2, etc. EASE allows<i> </i>you to use labels that are
more descriptive and we strongly advise you to do so for the Audience Areas,
Loudspeakers and Listener Seats. It makes everything so much easier.</p>
<p><b>Moving
Audience Areas</b></p>
<p>Notice
that the Audience Area labeled BAL, the balcony Audience Area, does not overlap
or shadow the two main floor Audience Areas (areas A2 &amp; Main) as it does in
the actual room. This is because EASE allows you to move Audience Areas for
display purposes. If you want to try this out, return to the <i>Main</i> menu
and open the <i>Edit Project</i> program. Then select <i>Area Layout</i> from
the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu to view the Audience Areas. Pick one of the
Audience Areas and then select <i>Move</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu.
The cursor will now turn from a pointer into a pair of pliers. Use the pliers
to grab the selected Audience Area and move it around the screen. It's that
easy to re-arrange Audience Areas for easy viewing.</p>
<p><b>Mapping</b></p>
<p>Clicking
on any one of the Mapping icons in the Tool Bar section of the Area Mapping
window will initiate the Mapping procedure and open the Settings dialog box.</p>
<p><img
width=264 height=267 src="E3.files/image047.jpg"></p>
<p>This
window and the ones that follow remind you of the parameters that need to be
set up before a simulation. The Settings tab is where you select the frequency
of the simulation, choose what loudspeaker(s) will be used and decide upon the
resolution.</p>
<p>You
also are presented with the choice of running a <i>Single</i> map or of using
the <i>All</i> <i>Mappings </i>feature. When<i> All Mapping </i>is selected,
the program gathers all the<i> </i>data it needs to quickly display all the
simulations available at any frequency. This is a great time saver when you are
doing a detailed analysis. We suggest using the <i>All Mapping</i> option and
selecting <i>Direct SPL</i> as the measure to show first.</p>
<p>Clicking
on the Loudspeaker button opens a list of the loudspeakers used in the model
and gives you the opportunity to select which ones will be used in the
sim-ulation.</p>
<p>We’ll
discuss the Resolution later. For now accept the default setting. Click on <i>Next

<p>Click
on the <i>Aud. Are</i>a button and select all four of the Audience Areas. Note
that the easy way to do this is to right click on the <i>OK</i> button to

<p>Then
either open the <i>Noise</i> tab or click on <i>Next</i> to open it.</p>
<p>The
Noise setup window allows you to set the noise levels (modify the de-fault
settings established in Room Data) that will be used in intelligibility
cal-culations. These are important to accurate Intelligibility projections, so
don’t overlook them. Accept the default settings for now and click on <i>Next</i>.</p>
<p><img
width=264 height=267 src="E3.files/image050.jpg"></p>
<p>The
Calculations window allows you to make further adjustments to the de-fault
settings established in Room Data. Shadowing can be turned On or Off. When
Shadowing is On, EASE takes into account the shadowing effect of any objects in
the room, such as columns and balconies. When it's Off, it doesn't.</p>
<p>Under <i>Interference</i>,
make sure <i>Interference Sum</i> and <i>Third Octave</i> are checked and the <i>Split
Time</i> is set to 35. Refer back to page 182 for further information on these
settings if you feel you need it. For now, accept the de-fault settings.</p>

<p><b>Display
Methods</b></p>
<p>Before
we go on let’s take a look at the various mapping display methods offered by
EASE. Control of the display method is provided by the four Tool Bar display
icons or by using the View pull down menu.</p>
<p>The
default display method and the method we have used so far in the Tutorial is
commonly called Color Patches; the View pull down menu lists it as Patch Grid
and Painted.</p>
<p>Another
method uses Isobars instead of Patches. The isobar graphic below was made by
turning Painted (Color) off and Labels On.</p>
<p>Note
that if you going to use a black &amp; white Isobar display, Labels must be on
or all you will see is blank areas.</p>
<p><img
width=504 height=310 src="E3.files/image053.jpg"></p>
<p>The
next graphic was made with with Patch Grid turned On and Coloring turned Off.
It plainly shows why the method is called Patches or Patch Grid. EASE scans
each square (Patch) sequentially to develop the display.</p>
<p><img
width=504 height=310 src="E3.files/image054.jpg"></p>
<p>The
size of each Patch determines the resolution and the amount of time needed to
do the calculation. The smaller the Patch size, the higher the resolution and
the longer the calculation takes.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>Chapter
9: Room Investigatiions</b></p>
<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>Control
of the resolution is provided by the first Calculation Parameters setup window.
See below.</p>
<p><img
width=332 height=332 src="E3.files/image055.jpg"></p>
<p>We have
been using 1 for the patch size and 1 dB for the Isoline display. The display
shown below was made using a patch size of 3. No-tice the loss of resolution.</p>
<p>Notice
that the setup window also contains a <i>Use Area Setting</i> check box and a <i>L/8</i>
button. The Properties window for Audience Areas al-lows you to define the scan
resolution for each individual Audience Area. Checking <i>Use Area Settings</i>
tells the program to use these set-tings instead of the Patch Size setting.
Pressing the L/8 button changes the resolution (the patch size) to 1/8
wavelength at the frequency chosen for the simulation (.14 feet at 1000 Hz and
.07 feet at 2000 Hz, for example).</p>
<p><img
width=504 height=310 src="E3.files/image056.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that in all the Mapping displays, you can obtain a readout of the level at any
point by left clicking on that point; right clicking will both readout the
level and write it on the display.</p>

<p>The
large button on the left (the + button in the above graphic) opens and closes
the bottom Evaluation Display portion of the window. It al-lows you to close
the bottom portion of the window, so you can see the Map.</p>
<p>The <i>Open

review. The <i>Floppy Disk</i> icon button next to it is used to save the
current simulation as a .emp Map file. The <i>Notepad</i> icon is used to save
the current file in an ASCII .txt format. The <i>Waste Basket</i> icon is used
to delete the current simulation file from the View Calculation module and
choose another one from the File Listing drop down menu.</p>
<p>The
left colorful Map icon is used to draw a new Map. Lets try it out. Open the
drop down menu directly below the Redraw button and se-lect a new simulation
type. Note that you have a wide variety to choose from. Selecting one, STI for
example, and then pressing the <i>Re-draw </i>button will quickly produce an
STI map in place of the Direct SPL map. Since we used All Mapping, the program
doesn't have to rerun<i> </i>the entire simulation. All it has to do is scan
the data it collected and render the drawing, a process that takes only a few
seconds.</p>
<p>The
right colorful Map icon allows the selection of all simulations and all
frequencies and frequency resolutions. Pressing the icon, opens a drop down
menu giving you the choice of <i>Render All</i> or <i>Send to EASEPaD</i>. <i>Render
All</i> will render all the Maps selected and <i>Send To</i> <i>EASEPaD </i>will
both render the Maps and send them to<i> EASEPaD </i>for further processing.</p>
<p>Selecting
one of the two choices will open the selection menu shown below. The buttons

<p>The <i>Frequency</i>
drop down menu allows you to quickly select the center point of the frequency
band that will be used in the next simulation while the <i>Bandwidth</i> drop
down menu determines the width of the frequency band.</p>
<p>Note
that you have a choice of Third Octave, One Octave, Three Octaves, Broadband
and a number of specific frequencies. One Octave will average the results over
one octave, while Broadband will show the results averaged across the entire

set the lower frequency limit and the numerical frequency listings to set the
upper limit, 1000 Hz plus to 5000 Hz for example.</p>
<p>The wider
the bandwidth, the less apparent the effects of comb filtering. As a general
rule, simulations run with a 3 octave bandwidth come closest to simulating the
variations you will hear while &quot;walking&quot; the room during the final

<p><b>C
(Clarity) Calculations</b></p>
<p>C
(Clarity) calculations offer several ways to evaluate the acoustic performance
of a room and its loudspeaker system. They are widely used in Europe.</p>
<p><b>C7 </b>is
equivalent to the D/R ratio widely used in the U.S. and represents another way
to look at the strength of the Direct Sound field. It<b> </b>displays in dB the
ratio of direct and reverberant sound using a Split Time of 7 ms. Values above
-15 dB show good localization (a good D/R ratio). The closer the value comes to
0, the better the localization.</p>
<p><b>C50 </b>is used
to project speech intelligibility. It displays the ratio of energy before and
after 50 ms; i.e., its similar to Alcons with a 50 ms Split<b> </b>Time. Any
value above 0 dB in a room with normal reverberation represents good
intelligibility. In rooms with higher than normal reverbera-tion, any value
above -5 dB is considered good.</p>
<p><b>C80 </b>is
often called a clarity ratio. It uses an 80 ms Split Time to predict the
articulation (clarity) of different types of music. In other words, it<b> </b>provides
a look at the room's musical performance. A brief explanation follows.</p>
<p>Musical
instruments can be divided into four basic types:</p>
<p>1. Blown instruments (e.g., organ, tuba, clarinet, etc.)
These instruments have a slow attack and slow decay.</p>
<p>2. Bowed instruments (e.g., violin, viola, cello, bass
etc.) These instruments have slightly quicker attack and slow decay.</p>
<p>3. Plucked instrument (e.g., guitar, string bass,
harpsichord, etc.) These instruments have quick attack and medium slow decay.</p>
<p>4. Percussive
instruments (e.g., piano, drums, electronic instruments, xylophone etc.) These
instruments have a quick attack and a quick decay.</p>

<p><img
width=665 height=1 src="E3.files/image003.jpg"></p>
<p>The
scale for interpreting C80 follows:</p>
<p>• 0 +/- 2 dB is ideal for organ or blown instruments played
at a slow rate of speed. This is perfect for organ recital halls</p>
<p>• 2
+/-2 dB is ideal for bowed instruments and is best shown by a room made for
classical or symphonic instrumental music. The speed of the music is quicker.
The music of live choirs is also good at this level. This would be good for
traditional churches</p>
<p>• 4
+/-2 dB is ideal for plucked instruments. The speed of the music is quicker as
well as more modern. This would be described as folk music or in churches as
Light Contemporary. This would also cover light popular music such as Light
Jazz</p>
<p>• 6
+/-2 dB is ideal for percussive instruments. This can be described best as Rock
and Roll. In churches this would be known as Full Contemporary.</p>
<p>For
good musical performance, the number should not exceed +8 dB at any location. A
C80 plot for Theater1 follows.</p>
<p><img
width=391 height=241 src="E3.files/image070.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Csplit</b></p>
<p>Csplit
offers a way to look at the energy ratios before and after the selected Split
Time. It gives you the opportunity to see the effect of dif-ferent Split time
settings. The selected Split Time in this case, of course, is the Split Time we
set up before running the All Mapping simula-tion (35 msec.)</p>
<p><b>D/R
Ratios</b></p>
<p>D/R
Ratio shows the ratio of direct to reverberant sound in terms of dB. Zero dB
indicates the sound levels are the same. Numbers less than 0 indicate the
reverberant sound level is higher than the direct sound level. Numbers greater
than 0 indicate the direct sound level is higher. Note that in Theater 1 the
reverberant level is higher than the direct sound level. This is not unusual.</p>

<p><b>Critical
Distance</b></p>
<p>Critical
Distance displays the ratio of Direct to Reverberant sound in terms of
distance. Critical Distance is the distance in space at which the Direct and
Reverberant sound levels are equal. This is displayed as a 1. Figures of more
than 1 indicate the reverberant sound level at this distance is higher than the
direct sound coming from the loudspeakers. Figures lower than 1 indicate that
at this distance from the Loudspeakers the Direct Sound level is higher than
the level of the reverberant field.</p>
<p>A
Critical Distance plot for Theater 1 appears below. Note all the figures are
above 1, another indication that the reverberant field is higher in level than
the Direct Sound.Pressure Levels</p>

<p><b>Pressure
Levels L7, L50, L80, Lsplit</b></p>
<p>The L7,
L50 and L80 simulations allow you to look at the sum of the direct and
reverberant sound energy within the specified time; for ex-ample the first 7
msec when L7 is used. Lsplit uses the split time set up for the simulation, in
this case 35 msec. In other words, Pressure Level simulations are similar to
the C7, C50, C80, Csplit calculations, except they show you the total sound
during the specified period.</p>
<p><b>Total
SPL (SUM)</b></p>
<p>Sum or
Total SPL displays the sum of the Direct and Reverberant sound energy in dB. In
other words, it displays the total sound level.</p>
<p>Don't
be surprised at the small variation between the minimum and maximum levels.
It's normal.</p>
<p><b>Arrival
Time</b></p>
<p>Arrival
Time (First) shows the arrival times of the direct sound from the loudspeakers in
terms of msec. It is extremely useful in determining the amount of delay needed

<p>Lspk
Overlap shows the number (quantity) of loudspeakers of comparable intensity
providing sound at a specific location. A value of 1 indi-cates that there is
no overlap. Values greater than 1 indicate the amount of overlap. As a general
rule, values of 1.5 or greater indicate that comb filtering or other
undesirable interference behaviors may be expected at that location. A Lspk

<p><b>Ray
Tracing</b></p>
<p>Ray
Tracing is an often used concept in CAD programs for the rendering of
illuminated objects. In EASE, Ray Tracing is used to study the propagation of
sound rays. Rays are released into the room and each Ray's path is traced until
it reaches predetermined limits.</p>
<p>Ray
Tracing allows you to study reflection patterns within the room by emitting
rays whose reflection paths can be viewed and investigated. The key words in
the previous sentence are &quot;reflection patterns&quot;. The Ray Tracing
routine does not allow you to investigate reflections that hit a specific spot
within the room. Comparatively few rays are needed in Ray Tracing to produce
the quantity of rays needed for reflection pattern studies and for the Movie
module. Consequently, Ray Tracing reflection pattern studies are relatively
quick to make. Only a few hundred rays and low order reflection orders are
needed. The maximum for EASE JR users is 1000 rays and Third-Order reflections.</p>
<p><img
width=198 height=121 src="E3.files/image079.jpg"></p>
<p>To
start Ray Tracing, if the <i>Edit Project</i> module is open close or minimize
it and then return to the <i>Main</i> menu and open the <i>Calculations</i>
pull down menu. Selecting <i>Ray Tracing</i> will open the Prompt shown to the

<p>The <i>Loudspeaker</i>
and <i>Lspk Group</i> but-tons are used to select the loudspeakers that will be
used in the simulation, while the <i>Rays per Loudspeaker</i> field deter-mines
how many rays will be emitted by each loudspeaker. The thing to remem-ber while
making these setups is that the larger the number of loudspeakers and the more
rays emitted by each loud-speaker, the longer the calculation time.</p>
<p><img
width=458 height=262 src="E3.files/image081.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Trace
Control By</i> section sets up the ray cutoff parameters for the simulation. <i>Order
</i>determines how many reflections<i> </i>(bounces) the program will trace,
before going on to the next ray. For reflection pattern studies no more than
Third-Order</p>
<p>reflections
(the maximum allowed by EASE JR) are needed.</p>
<p><i>Time </i>establishes
the length of the investigation. Lengths of 100 to 300 ms are typical for Ray
Tracing, although shorter and longer times<i> </i>are possible. <i>Loss</i>
cuts off the ray trace when the SPL has dropped the specified amount. This is
typically set at 60 dB.</p>
<p><i>Directed
Emission </i>produces a weighted display used primarily to enhance simple
reflection studies and Movie presentations.</p>
<p>The <i>Tracing
Options</i> section determines how the rays will be displayed and whether or
not they will be saved in a <i>Trace</i> file. When <i>Draw</i> <i>Trace Rays </i>is
checked the program will draw the rays in the<i> View Project </i>screen. The
rays will appear in rapid order on the screen as their<i> </i>paths are
calculated by the program unless <i>Show Every Ray</i> is also checked.
Checking <i>Show Every Ray</i> allows you to manually step through and observe
the rays one by one as they are calculated.</p>
<p>When <i>Brief
Ray Info</i> is checked, information on each Ray's path will flash across the
Ray Tracing Control window while the window color flashes with the Ray's color.</p>
<p><i>Make
Trace File </i>saves the results of the simulation in a .trc Trace file for
later viewing and analysis using<i> View Trace File</i>. View Trace File<i> </i>provides
many more viewing options than Ray Tracing, including the ability to
individually look at each loudspeakers reflection pattern.</p>
<p>Because
of this, many experienced users will run an extensive trace file using all of

set the <i>Order</i> to 3, the <i>Time</i> to 200 ms and the <i>Loss [dB]</i>
to 60 dB. We'll use <i>Directed Emission</i>, too, as we'll be using<i> </i>the
Movie feature shortly. Note that you have to put a check in the <i>Time [ms]</i>
and <i>Loss [dB] </i>boxes before you can fill in the<i> </i>fields. Then put
checks into <i>Draw Trace</i> <i>Rays </i>and<i> Brief Ray Info</i>. The setup

<p>Before
you click on <i>OK</i>, make sure you can see the View Project window. You'll
may want to rearrange the screen to get a better view of it.</p>
<p>Now
click on <i>OK</i>. Notice that the room quickly fills up with yellow and
magenta rays. The magenta color rays are the programs way of telling you that
the time window is too short; that many of the rays are being cut off by the
time limitation before their trace is completed. Do the Ray Trace again with
the <i>Time</i> set to 400 ms and you'll see the magenta rays disappear, an
indication they are now being allowed to finish their trace. Note that the Ray
Tracing Control window summarizes the completed simulation.</p>

<p>Also
notice that as soon as you <i>OK</i> the <i>Computation Ready</i> prompt that
appears at the end of the tracing routine the rays disappear. The same thing
happens if you attempt to rotate or enlarge the room to get a better view of
the rays. The way around this is to use the <i>Make</i> <i>Trace File </i>option,
so most users will automatically make a Trace File every time they do an
investigation. Its easier to work with and more<i> </i>flexible. Let's see how
this works.</p>
<p>Open

are not checked. All we want to do is to make a Trace File and forcing the
program to draw the rays only slows down the computations. Click on <i>OK</i>.
This will brings up a screen which al-lows you to name the file and choose its

<p>Another
thing that can be done in View Trace File is to look at only the Rays generated
within the loudspeaker -3 dB, -6 dB and -9 dB cov-erage cones. To try this out,
click on the <i>Ray Tracing Contro</i>l window and press <i>F9</i>, or go to

<p>Note
that the program allows you to Hide certain items. If we had wanted to show
only the -3 dB cone, we would have checked the Hide boxes associated with -6 dB

<p>Another
useful Ray Tracing feature of EASE 4.3 allows you to view the first order
reflections from a specific Face in the same color as the Face color itself.
This option is useful in determining the proper inclination of reflector or
side wall panels and in studying reflections from troublesome Faces. Let's try
it out using the right side wall and the ceiling in our model.</p>
<p>We'll
start by changing the color of the ceiling Face to bright Red and 0ne side wall
to a vivid Blue. This will make it easier for us to differen-tiate between the
ceiling and side wall reflections. Face colors can't be changed in View
Project, so we'll have to open the Edit Project module and change the colors
there.</p>
<p>Open
the <i>Edit Project</i> module, if it isn’t already open, and pick the ceiling
Face and use the right mouse button to open the Mouse menu and then either
select the Ceiling Face’s <i>Properties</i> folder and change the Face color to
red or select <i>Color</i> and change it. Note that <i>Ctrl +</i> <i>F2 </i>would
also open the color change dialog window. Follow the same procedure to change
the color of the side wall to bright blue. Then</p>
<p><i>Check
Data [F5] </i>and return to the<i> Ray Tracing </i>module.</p>
<p>Use <i>Ctrl
+ o</i> to <i>Acquire</i> the changes you made in Edit Project. and then open
the Options folder <i>(F9)</i> and select <i>1. Reflection Face Color</i> <i>Only.
OK </i>the change to return to the Rays control window and select Ray Tracing
from the Rays pull down menu.</p>
<p>We want
to study the reflections from the Main Loudspeaker off the one side wall and
the ceiling. Insert 1 in the Trace Control Order field, 20 in the Rays per
Loudspeaker field and select the Main Loudspeaker. Under Tracing Options select
Make Trace File and proceed by fol-lowing the prompts.</p>
<p>You may
want to rerun the simulation using a few more Rays or 2nd order reflections to
gain further insight into the reflection pattern. It’s easy to do. The

<p>Our
initial Trace File was was made using only 500 Rays from just the Main and
delayed Balcony Loudspeakers, so you will not be able to see the Downfill,
Under Balcony and Stage Lip Loudspeakers in the Movie. If you want to see them,
you’ll need to make a new Trace File with all the Loudspeakers turned On. Note
that the opening <i>View Trace File</i> window allows you to select what
Loudspeakers will be used in the Movie. You probably will also want to increase
the number of rays. Using more rays per loudspeaker enhances the Movie display.</p>
<p>The

<p><b>Room
Mapping</b></p>
<p>So far
in this Tutorial section we have used only Area Mapping. Room Mapping is
similar to Area Mapping, except that it also allows Map-ping on the Room
surfaces. The setup routine is identical except that you now have a choice of
Mapping on just the Audience Area(s) or the Room surfaces (Faces) or on both.</p>
<p>Note
that in Room Mapping EASE JR users can map only Direct SPL. EASE users have the
option of mapping other measures on the Au-dience Areas and Room Surfaces
(Faces). If you skipped the Overview section of the Tutorial, please return to
pages 35-39 for a more de-tailed description of the two mapping methods.</p>
<p>Room
Mapping is accessed by selecting <i>Room Mapping</i> under the <i>Calculations</i>
pull down menu and following the same steps you followed in Area Mapping.. The
graphic below shows a Direct SPL Map on the Audience Areas as it appears in
Room Mapping.</p>

used in the simulations. The other loudspeakers were all turned Off.</p>

<p>Notice
the black area behind the front Face of the balcony. It shows that this area is
being shadowed by the balcony Face. This didn’t show in Area Mapping since the
Audience Area is at ear height and is not being shadowed by the balcony Face.</p>
<p>The
same holds true for the very rear of the Main floor, only in reverse. In Area
Mapping someone seated in the rear seats of the main foor</p>
<p>Audiences
Areas was shadowed from the Main Loudspeaker by the balcony. However, the floor
under them is not in the shadowed area.</p>
<p>EASE is
very precise.</p>
<p>The
black areas in the back stage area are an indication that EASE had difficulty
calculating a level because of the resolution used in the simulation. Change to
a higher resolution and they will disappear.</p>
<p>You may
wonder why the backstage Faces show an SPL level even though they do not have a
“line of sight” view of the main Loud-speaker. How can they receive Direct
Sound? Remember, we defined Direct Sound to include early reflections that
arrive within 35 ms (a 35 ms Split Time). You are looking at the levels of the
early reflections.</p>

<p>All the
Mapping functions we reviewed in Room Investigations are avail-able in both
EASE and EASE JR. <b>Now, it's time to move on to simula-tions that are
available only to EASE users.</b></p>
<p><b>Local
Decay Times</b></p>
<p>EASE
4.3 has the ability to quickly develop RT Times based on reflection studies.
The Eyring or Sabine formulas EASE JR and EASE use to calcu-late RT times are
generalized formulas that don't apply to every room.</p>
<p>For
example, they assume the room's absorption material is distributed
homogeneously on the room's surfaces, a condition that doesn't exist in every
room. The RT Times are also a single set of times for the entire room while in
real life the RT Times from one location to another.</p>
<p><i>Local
Decay Time </i>provides a quick check on the accuracy of these for-mulas, as
well as providing RT projections for specific points within the room. It uses
an omnidirectional source to distribute Rays throughout the room and calculates
the RT Time from their decay. The result is RT Times that are more &quot;real
life&quot; figures.</p>
<p><img
width=291 height=291 src="E3.files/image096.jpg"></p>
<p>Select <i>Local
Decay Times</i> is accessed in either Area Mapping or Room Mapping from the <i>Mapping</i>
pull down menu. We used Area Mapping which opened the Calculation Parameters’
setup window shown here. Note that it is similar to the one we have been using
in Area Mapping, but doesn't have a Loudspeaker selection section. The reason
is that the sys-tem loudspeakers won't be used to calculate the Local Decay
Times. In-stead an omnidirectional source will be used. This simulation is
interested only in the room's decay times.</p>
<p>Press <i>Next</i>
to bring up the second setup window which also should look familiar.</p>
<p>Note
that you have a choice of Mapping on Seats or Areas or both. Al-though you can
map on Areas, we suggest Mapping on only the Seats. Mapping on Areas will take
a considerable amount of time because of the number of points involved, which
defeats our objective of doing a quick check. Select <i>Seat</i>s and then use
the <i>List Seat</i> button to select all 5 of the Listener Seats.</p>
<p><img
width=291 height=291 src="E3.files/image097.jpg"></p>
<p>Now,
press <i>Next</i> to open the Noise setup window; accept the default set-tings
and press <i>Next</i> to move on to the Calculation setup window.</p>
<p>We
suggest using the Default settings. Using more Rays or a larger Re-flection
Order would yield more precise figures, but we are just looking for a quick
check and the default settings will be adequate.</p>

<p><b>Standard
Mapping With Reflections</b></p>
<p>Standard
Mapping uses a statistical formula to calcu-late reflected sound levels from
the Direct Sound lev-els and the RT Times developed by either the Eyring or
Sabine formulas. <i>Standard With Reflections</i> (avail-able under the Mapping
pull down menu in either Area Mapping or Room Mapping) replaces the generalized
Eyring or Sabine generated RT times with RT times developed by Ray Tracing. It
is a more accurate method, but the calculations take considerable more time.
How much more time depends on the complex-ity of the room, the number of
loudspeakers involved, the number of Rays you choose to use, the Reflection
Order you select and the speed of your computer.</p>

or Room Mapping. Select <i>Local Ray Tracing</i> from the <i>Tools</i> pull

fine to provide a quick snap shot of what's happening at the chosen location.
Far more Rays per Loudspeaker and much higher re-flection orders would be

<p><b>Ray 
Tracing Impacts (Find Impacts)</b></p>
<p><i>Find
Impacts </i>is a Ray Tracing option that registers rays that pass within a
meter of the chosen point (impact upon a 1 meter counting bal-loon), stores the
results and then automatically runs a mirror image routine to identify the
impacts that hit the center of the counting bal-loon. <i>Find Impacts</i>
requires a larger number of rays (100,000 or more in many cases) and higher
reflection orders than Local Ray Tracing. It relies upon the laws of
probability to identify an adequate number of impacts to ensure an acceptable
degree of accuracy. The computa-tional time is proportional to the number of
Faces; i.e., doubling the number of Faces doubles the time required. <i>Find
Impact</i> results are suitable for detailed acoustical investigations and EARS
auralizations.</p>
<p>From
the Main window, select <i>Ray Tracing</i> from the <i>Calculations</i> pull
down menu. Then select <i>Ray Tracing Impacts</i> from the <i>Rays</i> pull down
menu to open the initial <i>Find Impacts</i> set up menu shown below. Notice
that many of the choices are similar to the ones found under Ray Tracing.</p>
<p><img
width=327 height=204 src="E3.files/image104.jpg"></p>
<p>The
four buttons at the top allow you to select the Loudspeakers and Listeners
Seats that will be used in the study.</p>
<p>Keep in
mind the difference between Ray Tracing and Impact Studies is that Impact
Studies investigate only the Rays that hit (impact) a specific target, a 1
meter counting balloon surrounding the Listeners Seat. <i>Ray Tracing</i> does
not record impacts. <i>Find Impact</i> does. To save time in this exercise,
we’ll use the 5 Listeners Seats and only the Main loudspeaker and three Delay
loudspeakers.</p>
<p>The
search options are similar to the ones we explored under Ray Tracing, but now
we want to make an Impact file. Put a check in <i>Make</i> <i>Impact file</i>.
We could check<i> Brief Impact Info </i>and<i> Draw Impact Ray </i>but they
would not add much information to the simulation and would<i> </i>lengthen the
calculation time. The next step is to decide upon the length of the simulation.</p>
<p>A
general rule for producing good Impact files in a reasonable period of
calculation time is that the Room's <i>Mean Free Path Time</i> times the <i>Reflection
Order </i>should be approximately equal to the<i> Time Frame</i>. The<i> Mean
Free Path Time </i>for Theater 1 can be found in the Room<i> </i>Data folder.
(Open the Project Data module, right click on the screen and then select <i>Room
Data</i> from the Mouse Menu.)</p>
<p>It is
.03 sec. This means that if we want to use a Reflection Order of 10, the Time
Frame should be approximately 300 msec. Put a check in <i>Time (ms)</i> and
enter 300 into the <i>Time (ms)</i> field. Then <i>OK</i> the setup.</p>
<p>The
setup screen shown below will appear. Put a check in the Order selection box and
Insert 10 into the Order field.</p>

<p>Notice
that this menu is identical to the one we worked with under Ray Tracing, except
for having an <i>Impact Chance</i> field added. EASE will review our setup
parameters and use the <i>Impact Chance</i> field to tell us what the odds are
of registering all of the possible impacts. Ob-viously, the higher the
percentage the more accurate the simulation.</p>
<p>Notice
that the program entered a higher (longer) figure into the <i>Time</i> window
than the one we entered in the previous menu. The previous figure defined the
time frame from the first Impact. The figure shown in this menu also includes
the time from when the first Ray is gener-ated to its first Impact. We'll use
the 375 msec figure and start with an <i>Order</i> count of 10 and 100 <i>Rays
per Loudspeaker</i>.</p>
<p>You'll
notice the Impact Chance is quite small, so increase the number of Rays per
Loudspeaker to 10,000 and then to 50,000. It takes a lot of Rays to get the
Impact Chance over 50 %. 50% is not good enough for an auralization, so try
150,000 rays. This will improve the Im-pact Chance to almost 90%..</p>
<p>Notice
that we did not check Make Trace File or Draw Trace Rays. Our objective is to
make an Impact File and creating a Trace File or drawing the Trace Rays at the
same time only significantly lengthens the computation time without serving any
real purpose. We also did not check Directed Emission. Directed Emissions
produces a weighted display that is used primarily to enhance Movie
presentations.</p>
<p>We did,
however, put a check in the <i>Brief Ray Info</i> box. This tells the program
to flash brief information on each Ray and its color in the Ray Tracing control
screen. Yellow indicates the Ray was cut off by the Time Frame before it
impacted upon the Listener Seat. Magenta indi-cates that the cutoff was caused
by the Reflection Order limitation. Blue Rays are ones that Impact upon the
Listener Seat. During the sim-ulation, the Rays flash by so quickly you
probably won't be able to see the blue flashes, but you should see a good mix
of Yellow and Magenta flashes. If you only see Yellow, it's a sign that the
Time Frame may be to short. All Magenta flashes indicates the Reflection Order
probably should be higher.</p>
<p>Clicking
on <i>OK</i> will introduce a prompt reminding you the Impact Chance is less
than 100%.</p>
<p>Acknowledging
the prompt by clicking on <i>OK</i> will open a new window giving you the
opportunity to name the File and its destination. The simulation will start
after you have entered this information and approved it by clicking on <i>OK</i>.
Notice that after the simulation starts you will be given the approximate
length of time the simulation will require. It will be significant. On our 2
GHz machine the estimate was just under 1 1/2 hours. A 50,000 Ray study would
have taken about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>During
the simulation, an informational box will keep you up to date on the progress
of the study and the amount of time left.</p>

<p>When
the simulation is complete, the .log screen shown below will open partially
obscuring the Ray Control window. It records the parame-ters used for the
simulation and summarizes the results in text form. If you want, you can print
or save this information for future reference.</p>

<p>The

you. As you can see from the screen shown below, over 8600 impacts were
recorded. Note that the summary also tabulates the Impacts by their Order.</p>
<p>A

<p>Pressing

<p>Prompts
will appear giving you the opportunity to select what Loudspeakers and what
Seats will be used in the analysis.</p>

<p>Remember,
we created the <i>Impact File</i> using only the Main and Delay loudspeakers.
It's possible you might want to turn some of them Off to get a better look at
the effect of using, for example, just the main floor loudspeakers. We will use
all of them as we want to see the full system's performance.</p>
<p>As soon
as the Loudspeaker selection is approved by clicking on <i>OK</i>, another
prompt will appear asking for your <i>Seat</i> selection. You will be allowed
to select only one <i>Listener Seat</i> from those listed even if more than one
Listener Seat was included in the Impact study. Remem-ber, the object of this
investigation is to see what's happening at a specific spot.</p>
<p>It
should be noted here that including all 5 Listener Seats in our Impact study
instead of a single Seat did not increase the calculation time by a factor of
five. Instead, it only increased the time by about 50%. Most experienced users
will run their Impact studies on at least several strategically located
Listener Seats at one time. They will also schedule their activities so the
simulation can be run while they are doing something else, such as having
lunch.</p>

<p>Selecting
<i>Seat 5</i> and approving the selection by clicking <i>OK</i> will start the
process. When it is completed, a Reflectogram similar to the one shown below
will appear. Don't expect the Reflectogram to appear instantly. EASE has a lot
of data to review before it draws the Reflec-togram and it may take a minute or
two. Be patient.</p>
<p><img
width=577 height=416 src="E3.files/image112.jpg"></p>
<p>Now use
your Mouse and the Cursor to select one of the Impact Pulses and introduce a
readout on the screen showing the exact arrival time of that reflection and its
exact level. Note that if you use your right Mouse button to select the Pulse,
the program will write the same information on the screen.</p>
<p>Next,
click on the <i>Pick</i> icon in the Tool Bar section and then click on another
one of the Impact Pulses. Notice that the status bar below the Reflectogram now
gives you the number of the Pulse you selected, its origination point, time of arrival,
energy level, reflection order and ar-rival direction. This is all information
that EASE has stored on every impact for each of the 21 frequency bands.</p>
<p>To
check this out, click on the <i>Frequency</i> icon and choose a new frequency.
The program will then quickly redraw the Reflectogram for the new frequency. If
you want to look more closely at a certain section of the Reflectogram, use the
<i>F11</i> key stroke to Zoom In on the window or the Zoom icon and cursor to
Zoom in on a section of the Reflectogram.</p>
<p>Select
one of the Impact Pulses again and then minimize the Reflectogram and return to
the View Impact File control window, select the Ray tab. Note that the control
window identifies the Impact Pulse you selected, traces its patch Face by Face
and gives you the Arrival time and level. The View Project window also traces
the Impact Pulse’s path.</p>
<p>You can
also view the reflections by <i>Reflection Order</i>. Go to the <i>View</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Reflection Orde</i>r. Then select the <i>Order</i>
you want to see, 3 for 3rd Order for example. EASE will now highlight all the
3rd Order Reflections. You can easily view other Reflection Orders by using <i>Ctrl</i>
- or <i>Ctrl +</i> keystrokes to move to a lower or higher Order.</p>

<p>The <i>Waterfall</i>
is another interesting display. It's accessible by clicking on its tool bar
icon or through the Graph pull down menu. You'll find it under <i>Time Response</i>.
What makes the Waterfall interesting is that it shows at a glance the energy
level and arrival time for each impact at each of the 21 frequencies.</p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image113.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that you can Zoom in on it to get a better view of a specific section and that
you can also select any one of the Impulses by clicking on it. You most likely
will notice that as you switch from one presentation screen to another, the
Pulse selection follows making it easy to look at a particular pulse in several
different ways.</p>
<p>The <i>3-D
Hedgehog</i> display shown below provides another interesting view. It shows
the Pulse Directionality in a distinctive fashion. The 3-D Hedgehog display can
be accessed either by clicking on its tool bar icon or in the <i>Graphs</i>
pull down menu under <i>Pulse Directionality</i>.</p>
<p>You
probably also noticed two other listings in the Pulse Directionality menu, <i>Horizontal</i>
and <b>Vertica</b>l. Selecting these produces vertical and horizontal views of
the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>Two
more important EASE displays are the <i>Impulse Response (IR)</i> display and <i>Energy
Time Curve (ETC</i>). EASE calculates the Impulse Response by convolving all 21
of the 1/3 octave band reflectograms with a Unity Sphere. This produces a
monaural IR you could measure in real life with an omnispherical microphone. To
look at the Impulse Response, click on the <i>IR (Impulse Response)</i> icon in
the tool bar or use the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu and select <i>Time
Response/Impulse Response.</i></p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image115.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Energy
Time Curve (ETC)</i> is developed by squaring and transforming the IR signal.
Click on the <i>Show ETC</i> icon or use the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu and
select <i>Time Response</i>.</p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image116.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Frequency
Response</i> curve shown on the next page is available by going to the <i>Graphs</i>
pull down menu or by clicking on its tool bar icon. As you see, it shows both
the 1/3 octave average energy levels and the detailed response curve. Also
notice that you are looking at an A weighted curve. An unweighted curve can be
obtained by going to the <i>Frq.Rsp</i> section of the <i>Options</i> folder
and removing the check in the <i>Levels in db (A)</i> box. Use the <i>Appl</i>y
button to see the difference A weighting makes.</p>

<p>You
probably noticed a number of deep dips in the response curve. To find out how
deep these are, select the <i>Pick</i> tool and then click on the response
curve. This will turn the cursor into crosshairs that can be moved along the
response curve with the right and left arrow keys. Let's check out the one that
appears to be slightly below 3000 Hz. You'll find out the hole is actually at
2806 Hz and is over 30 dB deep.</p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image117.jpg"></p>
<p>Another
useful EASE feature is the use of MTF's (Modulation Transfer Functions) as a
basis for high accuracy intelligibility predictions. The program uses the seven
averaged frequency dependent octave band Impulse Responses to calculate by
means of 14 modulation frequen-cies the MTI values. From these, EASE derives
the MTF curves and the STI (Speech Transmission Index) for Standard (average),
Male, and Female speech. To initiate this function, click on the <i>Show MTF</i>
icon or go to the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu, select <i>Expectation Values</i>
and then <i>MTF/STI</i>. A typical MTF/STI display appears below.</p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image118.jpg"></p>
<p>The
calculated STI figures appear at the top of the screen; STI is the average
figure, M is for Male speech and F is female speech.</p>

<p>The

under the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu.</p>
<p>You are
able to step through all of these presentations one by one by using the Arrow
icons in the Tool Bar.</p>
<p><b>RT
Displays &amp; Schroeder RT</b></p>
<p>Our
review of Probe functions wouldn't be complete without looking into the RT
displays. Selecting <i>Reverberation Time</i> from the <i>Reverber-ation </i>section
under the<i> Graphs </i>pull down menu will draw the RT curve calculated using
the<i> “Provided Formula”</i>; the last RT Curve we<i> </i>looked at. In our
case, it will probably be the Local Decay Time we looked at in the Room
Investigations section of this Tutorial.</p>
<p>Then
open the <i>Options</i> menu (hit <i>F9</i> or right click on the screen and
select Options from the Mouse menu) and open the Rev. Time tab.</p>
<p><img
width=461 height=376 src="E3.files/image119.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Replace
by</i> section will change the display of the figures in the RT display for the
chosen RT formula and then use these figures in any future Probe calculations
using RT times. If <i>Schroeder</i> is chosen, the program will also calculate
the RT time based on Schroeder's reverse integration formula and the
Reflectogram's energy levels.</p>
<p>The
Display section will draw the RT curves for the selected formula(s) on the RT
graph. Note that before you will be able to see the Schroeder curve, you must
first press the Schroeder button in the <i>Replace By</i> section to tell the
program to calculate Schroeder RT fig-ures.</p>
<p>Let’s
display the Schroeder RT Times , as well as those calculated by Eyring and
Sabine formulas. Check all three.</p>
<p>As you
can see from the curves show on the next page, there are noticeable differences
between the projections.</p>
<p>In general,
the RT times projected by Schroeder are considered to be more accurate.
Remember, both Sabine and Eyring are generalized formulas. Schroeder is based
on the declining energy levels projected by the program.</p>
<p>The RT
times projected by Schroeder also will vary from Listeners Seat to Listeners
Seat, while the generalized Eyring and Sabine formu-las produce only one RT
time for the room. Another thing to remember while looking at the graph is that
the scaling accentuates the differ-ences.</p>

<p>Let's
try out the Schroeder backward integration method. If the Options menu isn't
still open, open it (<i>Options Menu [F9]</i>) and select the <i>Schroeder </i>tab.</p>
<p><img
width=461 height=376 src="E3.files/image121.jpg"></p>
<p>Note
that <i>Add Estimated Exponential Tail Energy</i> and <i>Include Pulses Outside
Start/Stop Times</i> are checked. When checked <i>Add Estimated</i> <i>Exponential
Tail Energy </i>tells EASE to add and use a calculated tail in its RT
calculations.<i> Include Pulses Outside Start/Stop Times </i>tells the<i> </i>program
to use all the pulses in the Reflectogram even if some are outside the Start
and Stop times entered for the Regression Interval.</p>
<p><i>Add
Energy Due to Impact Chance </i>is mainly used with short
reflectograms to get realistic Reverberation Tails in the calculations. You'll<i>
</i>want to check out the differences these settings make.</p>

<p>Note
that selecting <i>Draw Schroeder Curve into Reflectogram</i> will add the
Schroeder curve to the Reflectogram. See below.</p>
<p><img
width=559 height=335 src="E3.files/image122.jpg"></p>
<p>EASE
also allows you to compare the rooms projected RT times to the times normally
considered ideal for various types of usage. To ex-plore this option, go to the
<i>Reverberation</i> section of the <i>Graphs</i> pull down menu and select <i>Tolerance</i>.
This will add a Tolerance window to the graph.</p>
<p>Then
open the <i>Options</i> folder (<i>F9</i> or right click on the graph and
select <i>Options</i>) and click on the <i>Tolerance</i> tab to open the
Tolerance folder shown below.</p>
<p><img
width=396 height=322 src="E3.files/image123.jpg"></p>
<p>As you
can see, you have a choice of 3 Tolerance Norms. The Standard Norm is based on
European thinking and allows the rooms in-tended use to be taken in
consideration. Dolby, as the name implies was influenced by US theater
thinking, while THX is the standard used by Lucas Film for cinemas.</p>
<p>When
Standard is selected as the Norm, The Room Purpose buttons produce a new
tolerance window for the common usages shown. If you explore the variations you
will find the 1 kHz RT times vary from a low of 1.2 for Lecture/Sport
facilities to 2.2 for Organ Music.</p>

<p><b>Chapter

<p><img
width=673 height=362 src="E3.files/image124.jpg"></p>
<p>If you
explore the variations, you will notice that the RT times of the Theater 1 room
we have been using as a model are too low for good music reproduction. If you
skipped the Optimize RT section of the manual, now would be a good time to
review it and find out how EASE can help you determine what surface material
changes would increase the RT time.</p>
<p>Also
note that the RT times developed in the Probe module are used only in Probe
calculations. If you want to use the Schroeder figures in EASE Mapping, you
will need to manually copy them into <i>Edit Room/Room Data/Room RT</i> and
then check <i>RT Locked</i>.</p>
<p>Before
we move on to the next step, we should consider saving the Response file
(Reflectogram) we generated from the Impact File. Oth-erwise, it will be lost
when we exit this mode and will have to be recreated the next time we want to
look at it. Selecting <i>Save Response</i> <i>File As </i>under the<i> File </i>pull
down menu and following the prompts will take care of this. Now, exit from the
Find Impacts/Probe program.</p>
<p><b>Mirror
Image Impacts</b></p>
<p>Mirror
Image Impacts is another way to produce Impact Files. It uses rays like Ray
Tracing, but uses an algorithm to determine which rays will impact on the
target and then traces only those rays. It seeks out 100 % of the impacts and
leaves nothing to chance. But, the calcula-tions also take longer, especially
in rooms having a large number of Faces. Mirror Image Impacts is not
recommended for use in rooms having more than 40 Faces or in 10th order or
higher reflections studies.</p>
<p>Impact
Files generated by Mirror Image Impacts have the same characteristics as those
generated by Ray Tracing Impacts and are treated the same by the View Impacts
program. Selecting <i>Mirror Image Impacts</i> from the <i>Ray Tracing</i> pull
down menu opens the control screen shown below.</p>

<p><img

<p>If the
same setup criteria is used as the criteria we used before in Find Impacts,
namely a Reflection Order of 10 and a 375 ms Time frame, the calculation will
take many hours. Ray Tracing Impacts completed the calculations in less than 3
hours when 200,000 Rays were used.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
<p>A
general rule for producing good reflectograms in a reasonable period of time is
that the Mean Free Path Time of the room times the Re-flection Order should
approximately equal the Time Frame. The Mean Free Time can be found in the Room
Data folder under the Edit pull down menu in Edit Project. It is .03 sec or 30
ms for Theater 1. A Reflection Order of 12 times 30 gives us 360 ms for the
Time Frame.</p>
<p>With
these parameters, 100,000 Rays per loudspeaker produces an 80.5 % probability
factor. Refer to Chapter 11 on AURA and Chapter 12 on Auralization for more
information on creating good reflectograms.</p>
<p><b>Split
Impact File</b></p>
<p>If we
had elected to use only one Listeners Seat when we created our Impact File
using Find Impacts w would have had to run another simulation to look at other
Listener Seat locations. We avoided this by using all 5 seats in our original
Find Impacts study.</p>
<p>Many
experienced users will use multiple Listener Seats in their simulations and set
up any lengthy calculations at the end of the day so their computer work on
them overnight. The disadvantage of this is the large files they produce. Our 5
Listener Seat Impact File, for ex-ample, is over 100 MB.</p>
<p>Split
Impact File provides a means of easily breaking large, multiple Listeners Seat
files into individual files. Activation of <i>Split Impact Files</i> brings up
a prompt asking for the name of the file you want to split. Entering the file
name and clicking on <i>OK</i> will split the file into as many files as there
were Listeners Seats in the original file. The Files will identified with their
Listener Seat name, for example by -1,-2, etc..</p>
<p><b>Update
Impact File</b></p>
<p>Update
Trace File allows you to change wall materials or loudspeaker models in a model
and then quickly &quot;update&quot; (recalculate) associ-ated .trc Trace Files
and .mpc Impact Files. Changes that can be accommodated also include
loudspeaker aiming, delay and alignment. Geometric changes, such as relocating
a Loudspeaker or rearranging Faces cannot be handled by this feature.</p>
<p>Operation
is simple, open the <i>Update Trace File</i> window, enter the name of the file
you want to update and then hit the <i>OK</i> button.</p>
<p>One
word of caution about this feature. The Update Trace File routine upgrades the
existing File; it does not create a new one. Thus, you will lose access to the
existing file unless you first save it as a Response File or make a copy of it
under another name.</p>

<p>The
AURA, Analysis Utility for Room Acoustics, module is an extremely powerful
acoustical analysis tool.</p>
<p>Based
on the CAESAR algorithms developed by Aachen University (RWTH), AURA allows the
calculation of all key room acoustical pa-rameters defined in ISO3382, the
International Standard on Room Acoustic Measurements. These include</p>
<p>Early

<p>AURA is
a tool for producing more accurate and realistic acoustical simulations. AURA
initially creates an Echogram (Reflectogram) and then extracts from the Echogram
most of the measures simulated in Standard Mapping, plus a number of
standardized acoustical meas-ures that give the user a more detailed picture of
the room's acoustics and performance.</p>
<p>Whenever
an adequate number of reflections are simulated, an AURA simulation is more
accurate than one created solely from statistical mapping, which estimates the
diffuse field from reverberation time values calculated using generalized
formulas. Statistical mapping, how-ever, requires less time and computer
horsepower to produce its simulations.</p>
<p>We will
use a new model for our AURA exercises. You will find the room in the Examples
folder under EASE40 Data. It's identified as AURA1.</p>

<p>AURA
provides two simulation methods, AURA Mapping and AURA Response:</p>
<p><b>AURA Mapping </b>will map the acoustical
measures (according to ISO standard 3382) on Audience Areas or at individual Listener<b>
</b>Seats by developing an Echogram. AURA Mapping results are adequate for
mapping purposes but not for Auralization.</p>
<p><b>AURA
Response</b>, on the other hand, calculates a Reflectogram, from which a
Binaural Impulse Response can be extracted and<b> </b>used for Auralization.</p>
<p>Before
we start exploring Aura’s capabilities, let’s take a look at the room using
Area Mapping to get a feel for its performance.</p>
<p>Select <i>Area Mapping</i> from the <i>Calculations</i> pull
down menu. The first thing you will notice is that the Main floor Audience Area
is obscuring the Balcony Audience Area. The designer forgot to move one of the
audience areas so this wouldn't happen. No problem, return to the Edit Project
module and select <i>Area Layout</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu. Then
select <i>Move</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu and grab the Main Floor
Audience Area and move it out of the way.</p>
<p>Now
click on the <i>Direct SPL</i> icon. Select all five loudspeakers and both
Audience Areas in the Settings setup screen Also check <i>All Map-pings,then
click </i>on<i> Nex</i>t. When the Items and Noise screens open, accept the
default settings by pressing on<i> Nex</i>t. In the Calculation win-dow make
sure that <i>Map with Shadows</i> is turned On and then press <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Return
to the Area Mapping screen and rerun the Direct SPL simulation. As you can see
from the 1000 Hz to 4000 Hz plot shown below the loudspeaker system is
producing fairly smooth, high level direct sound coverage except in the corners
of the audience areas.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>Next, run an STI simulation. As you can see the intelligibility
looks pretty good.</p>
<p><img width=532 height=305
src="E4.files/image002.jpg"></p>
<p>This would also be a good time to look at the room’s RT60.
Return to the Main menu and from the <i>View</i> pull down menu select <i>Room</i>
<i>Info/Draw RT.</i></p>

<p><b>AURA Mapping</b></p>
<p><img width=266 height=269
src="E4.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, it's time to begin to explore AURA Mapping. Return to the
Area Mapping window and select <i>Aura</i> from the <i>Mapping</i> pull down
menu. This will open the Aura Mapping Settings dialog window.</p>
<p>As you can see it is almost identical to one we have been using
in Standard Mapping. The big difference is that only All Mapping is allowed.
Make sure all five loudspeakers are selected. Next, change the default label
(Calculation #1) to a more meaningful name, such as AuraCalc #1. Then click on <i>Next</i>.</p>
<p>When the Items tab opens notice that you have a choice of
carrying out your analysis on Audience Areas, at specific Listener Seats or
both. You can also choose which Audience Areas and Listener Seats are to be
included. (Note that if we had entered the AURA module through Room Mapping, we
would also be able to include Faces in the investigation.)</p>
<p>The calculation time associated with mapping on Audience Areas
in AURA needs to be carefully assessed. In AURA, Audience Areas are divided
into a grid of points and AURA will develop an Echogram/Reflectogram at each
point. The density of this grid is determined by the Resolution setting in the
previous Tab. If we had planned to use Area Mapping in this exercise, we would
probably have increased the Patch Size under Settings to at least 4, which is a
very low resolution setting when compared to the Patch Size we have been using
in Standard Mapping</p>
<p><img width=265 height=266
src="E4.files/image005.jpg"></p>
<p>Calculation time is also dependent, among other many factors, on
the number of particles (rays) that are used.. The denser the grid and the
higher the num-ber of particles, the more accurate the simulation and the
longer the calcula-tion will take. In many cases, however, the calculation time
would be very long, even with a powerful computing machine. This often prompts
a compro-mise between the different parameters. When compromising, be careful
not to set the Resolution setting too coarse as the maps can then be
misleading.</p>
<p>Another possibility is running the AURA calculations at individual
Listener Seats. The Echogram/Reflectogram is then created only at these points
and the Resolution settings are immaterial. The number of Listener Seats and
their locations can usually be set to yield adequate results in a reasonable
calculation time. By properly placing Listener Seats at representative
loca-tions in the room and then running AURA calculation at these
representative locations you can get descriptive results about the general
performance of the room relatively quickly.</p>
<p><img width=266 height=269

<p>How dense and how far apart these Listener Seats should be
placed is an issue, especially in large rooms where impulse response may change
drasti-cally from one location to another. In these cases a few Listener Seats
may not be enough to draw a descriptive picture of the room's performance and
more Listener Seats will have to be added.</p>

<p>The Calculations dialog window allows you to choose the number
of <i>Particle</i>s (Rays) that will be used in the simulation, the <i>Length</i>
of the simulation (the width of the Time window), the <i>Default Value</i> for
the Scattering factor that will be taken into account and the <i>Number of
Calculation Threads</i>.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image008.jpg"></p>
<p>The higher the number of Particles (used here as another
ex-pression for radiated rays), the denser the Echogram and the greater the
accuracy. A drop down selection wizard provides several presets that allow you
to choose between fast and rough calculations (<i>Very Low, Low Resolution</i>
settings) and slow and accurate calculations (<i>High, Very High Resolution</i>
settings). Normally, one would start the process by calculat-ing at a lower
resolution to obtain an overview and use higher resolutions once final results
are needed.</p>
<p>You may enter arbitrary particle numbers by selecting the
User-Defined list item. Notice that as you choose one of the resolution levels,
the number of Particles shown in the asso-ciated field changes.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image009.jpg"></p>
<p>A similar drop down menu assists in choosing an appropriate
length for the simulation. The minimum <i>Length [ms</i>] should be
approximately two thirds of the expected RT time. This is the default, labeled <i>Standard,
Fast</i>. The setting <i>Long</i> can be used to enhance the simulation
accuracy, for example in the case of flutter echoes, but it is seldom required.
The setting <i>Extended </i>should only be used if a significant deviation from<i>
</i>the statistical RT is to be expected, such as in coupled rooms.</p>
<p>Using the <i>User-Defined</i> setting you may enter your own
choice, for example for early-energy investigations only sev-eral hundred milliseconds
maybe enough. However, be aware that most room-acoustic measures require a
full-length impulse response</p>

<p><b>Chapter 11: AURA</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>One of AURA's features is its ability to include scattering
(diffusion) in its simulations. Surfaces exposed to sound waves exhibit, in
addition to the specular reflection of the sound waves in a certain direction,
some de-gree of <i>diffusion</i>, which is the scattering of the incident sound
wave in many different directions with considerably attenuated amplitudes. The <i>Scattering
</i>characteristics of Wall Materials, when known, can be entered<i> </i>into
the Wall Materials data base and used in AURA simulations. More details on this
feature follow near the end of this Tutorial section.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image010.jpg"></p>
<p>AURA also provides an <i>Add Scattering</i> feature that factors
a nominal amount of Diffusion into the simulations when the Diffusion
characteris-tics of the wall materials are not known. The <i>Default Value for
Surfaces</i> <i>without Scattering Data </i>defines how wall materials are
treated which<i> </i>have no scattering properties assigned.</p>
<p>Generally, a broadband scattering factor of 20% has turned out
to be a feasible choice for most projects. If your room has very large, smooth
walls you may want to switch to the setting <i>Smooth Flat Surfaces</i> with a
default scattering coefficient of 10%. If your room is very diverse and
in-cludes a lot of columns, diffusers, furniture or other elements you may want
to use <i>Considerable Surface Structures</i> which defines 40% of the
reflected energy as being scattered instead of specularly reflected.</p>
<p>If you want to be more accurate than that, you will need to
define scat-tering coefficients for each of the wall materials in use. We’ll go
into more detail on this later in the Tutorial. Note that if the Scattering
Coeffi-cients of all the wall materials being used have been defined, the
Scat-tering menu will be inoperative. EASE defines &quot;having Scattering
defined&quot; as having at least one 1/3 octave band defined.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276

<p>Introduced with EASE 4.3, the new version 3.0 of AURA features
multi-threaded calculations. This new function allows AURA calculations to be
performed in a fraction of the computation time required previously. It is
particularly efficient on computers having quad-core or larger proces-sors. For
any multi-core computer AURA may be faster by the number of cores compared to
the single-core computer. Additional improvements in AURA compared to the previous
versions further increase the speed gain even on a single-core computer.</p>
<p>To obtain the maximum performance choose the <i>Number of
Calculation</i> <i>Threads </i>equivalent to the number of processors (or
virtual processors)<i> </i>of your computer. Selecting a higher number will
result in too much switching overhead and does not increase the overall
performance. Se-lecting a lower number will keep your computer more responsive
to user input, for example, to work on another project or document while the
computation is running, but it will also slow down the calculation.</p>
<p>For this exercise we suggest using the number of threads equal
to the</p>
<p>number of processors in your computer. This will require almost
all of the</p>
<p>computer’s performance for the calculation, but will be the fastest.</p>

<p>The <i>Advanced Options &gt;&gt;</i> selection bar in the lower
right corner of the Calcula-tions window leads to a new dialog window.</p>
<p><img width=273 height=276
src="E4.files/image012.jpg"></p>
<p>AURA Mapping provides two methods of simulating the sound
propagation, <i>En-ergy Loss </i>and<i> Particle </i>Loss. In<i> Energy Loss</i>,
which is the default, the energy at<i> </i>every wall reflection is decreased
by (1-&#945;). In <i>Particle Loss</i> the energy at every wall reflection
remains constant, but a comparison between a random number (range from 0 to 1)
with the absorption coefficient &#945; of the wall will decide whether the ray
will be further traced or not. Energy Loss is more accurate un-less a high
number of Particles are used, but more time-consuming.</p>
<p>AURA also includes a <i>Diffuse Rain</i> option that recognizes
the scattered portion of the simulation more than the conventional method. It's
use is recommended in highly reverberant rooms (such as gyms) and rooms with
partially shadowed areas (such as theaters with deep under-balcony areas) and
side rooms (al-coves). In these cases, it requires smaller Particle numbers and
lower calcula-tion times than the conventional method. For example, 1/10 the
number of Particles is commonly used with Diffuse Rain.</p>
<p>The algorithms that support Diffuse Rain actually generate new
Rays whenever a Ray strikes a surface and follows these new Rays until they
impact upon a Listeners Seat. The energy level of the new Rays takes into
account the Surface's scattering coefficient as well as the surface's
absorption. The energy level of the primary specular reflected Ray is, of
course, reduced by the energy absorbed by the surface and the amount lost
through scattering.</p>
<p>Also available is the setting for <i>Orientation Point</i> which
is required for the correct use of LF and LFC investigations. This is the point
where the imagined receiving head is aimed at, since the two measures LF and
LFC depend on the direction of the intruding sound waves and thus on the
orientation of the receiver. It should normally be set to the coordinates of
the main loudspeaker or to a center point on the stage.</p>
<p>We won’t use <i>Particle Loss</i> or <i>Diffuse Rain</i> in this
simulation. Instead we'll use the default settings; <i>Low Resolution, Fast</i>
for the <i>Particles</i> setting and <i>Standard, Fast</i> for the <i>Length.</i>
figure. Please note, however, that 32,000 Particles is a relatively low figure.
As a result, the re-sults shown in our review may differ slightly from the ones
you get as you work through this exercise. If we used a higher number of
Parti-cles in these simulations, the variations would become smaller.</p>
<p>To start the simulation, press <i>OK</i>. You will then receive
an alert,telling you the amount of RAM and hard disk space needed to complete
the calculation. It gives you the opportunity to modify the setup parame-ters,

<p><b>Echograms</b></p>
<p>An Echogram differs from a Reflectogram in that an Echogram
stores all the energy arriving at a location in 1 ms wide boxes or bins as they
are commonly called (refer to the graphic shown below).</p>
<p>A Reflectogram records impacts (single</p>
<p>reflections) on a specific location and</p>
<p>stores them. The detailed information</p>
<p>provided by a Reflectogram requires sig-</p>
<p>nificantly more memory but it is also more</p>
<p>accurate and required for good auralizations.</p>
<p><img width=596 height=185
src="E4.files/image018.jpg"></p>
<p>Selecting the <i>Echogram</i> Tab will open the Echogram shown
at the top of the next page. Notice that we have selected Listener Seat #1 for
use in the following graphics and no weighting. Feel free to investigate the
performance at other Listen Seats and/or with A weighting as we go through this
exercise.</p>
<p>Note that the Red Sum and Blue Schroeder curves will not be
visible until you have turned them on. The Sum curve represents the energy
buildup at the chosen location, Listener Seat 1, as a function of time, while
the Schroeder curve is a backward-integration curve. It is used for calculating
the reverberation time</p>
<p>You can manipulate the <i>Time</i> and <i>Scale</i> axes to zoom
in and out on the Echogram. The <i>Step</i> option also allows you to increase
the box size from 1 ms to wider values to show energy summation in case of
identical reflection impacts. This is especially useful with calculations based
on Particle Loss. Try different input values under <i>Scale</i> and <i>Time
[ms]</i> and see for yourself what happens.</p>
<p>Before we check out the wide assortment of acoustical measures
offered by AURA Mapping, lets pause a minute to review a few basics. Classic
measures, such as RT60, D/R Ratio and Critical Distance, are useful indicators
of the acoustic performance of the Room and its sound system, but do not fully take
into account the subjective aspects of the listening experience.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>Chapter 11: AURA</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Over the years, acousticians have developed other measures that
more fully reflect the listener’s tonal perception of sound. ISO 3382, the
International Standard on Room Acoustic Measurements, defines these measures.</p>
<p>A detailed description of these measures is beyond the scope of
this Tutorial. For additional information, we can only refer you to the Ap-pendix
section of the EASE43Manual included in your EASE program and to acoustical
text books. Glenn Ballou's Handbook For Sound Engineers, Fourth Edition, for
example, contains an excellent review of this subject.. You'll find the EASE43
Manual stored under Program Files/EASE 4.3/Easepath/Ease43Manual..</p>
<p><img width=391 height=307
src="E4.files/image019.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, let’s return to the <i>Frequency</i> tab, and check what
acoustical measures AURA Mapping offers. We'll start with <i>EDT</i>. Go to the
drop down Measures selection box in the Tool Bars and select EDT.</p>
<p><b>EDT Early Decay Time</b></p>
<p>EDT stands for <i>Early Decay Tim</i>e, an important room
acoustical version of the RT. Instead of “measuring” the time needed for a 60
dB decay, <i>Early Decay Time</i> meas-ures the time needed for the first 10 dB
drop of the Schroeder decay curve (from 0 dB to -10 dB) and then extrapolates
the 60 dB decay time by multiplying by 6. EDT figures are more related to the
subjective RT impres-sion a listener gets in a room.</p>
<p><img width=391 height=313
src="E4.files/image020.jpg"></p>
<p>For example, compare the EDT curve at Listener Seat 1, to the
other Listener Seats. It is easy to do. Go to the Lo-cation section of the
Tools Bars and click on the &lt; and &gt; arrows to move from one Listeners
Seat to another. No-tice how quick and easy it is.</p>
<p>Note how the RT curves vary from one seat to another, especially
from Listener Seat 3 which is located under the balcony.</p>
<p>Also note that they vary considerably from the Room RT60 curve
calculated using the Eyring RT formula.</p>
<p>237</p>

<p><img width=456 height=365
src="E4.files/image021.jpg"></p>
<p><b>T Measures (T10, T20, T30)</b></p>
<p>Because of the differences between the objectively calculated
classical RT60 and subjectively perceived EDT impres-sions, other RT measures
were also in-troduced. For example, <i>T10</i> which is defined as the time
required, after ex-cluding the first 5 dB of decay, for the sound energy to
decay another 10 dB, multiplied by 6 to project the 60 dB decay time.</p>
<p>The T10 RT curve at Listener Seat 1 is shown to the right.. AURA
also calcu-lates T20 and T30 which have defini-tions close to those of EDT and
T10. Try them out. It only takes a few seconds.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=365
src="E4.files/image022.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Definition</b></p>
<p>Now select <i>Definition</i> at <i>Listener Seat 2</i>, to get
the Definition curve show below. <i>Definition </i>is one of a number of different<i>
</i>energy measures used in room acoustics. It defines what percent the energy
in the first 50 ms after the first arrival is of the total energy. For good
intelligibility a considerable part of the total energy (&gt;50%) should arrive
within this first 50 ms period</p>

src="E4.files/image023.jpg"></p>
<p><b>C50</b></p>
<p>The <i>C50</i> curve is shown on the right at <i>Listener Seat 3</i>,
where we can notice<i> </i>positive values at all one-third-octave bands with a
clear rise at the higher fre-quencies. Any value above 0 dB in a room with
normal reverberation repre-sents good intelligibility. In rooms with higher
than normal reverberation, any value above -5 dB is considered good.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=365
src="E4.files/image024.jpg"></p>
<p><b>STI Speech Transmission Index</b></p>
<p>Another frequently used intelligibility measure is the <i>STI
Speech Transmission</i> <i>Index </i>, which is a single number be-tween 0 and
1.</p>
<p><i>STI </i>is calculated from a set of other<i> </i>numbers called MTF
Modulation Trans-fer Function. It takes into account how the transmission from
source to receiver is affected at different frequency bands and how much these
frequency bands contribute to speech intelligibility. If you turn to the STI
display in our example, you will get the curve shown here, which shows an <i>STI</i>
of 0.694 at <i>Listener Seat</i> <i>3.</i></p>

<p>Before we leave the <i>STI</i> display, click on the <i>Options</i>
tab. Note that it offers you two variations to the <i>Standard STI</i>
calculation, one modified to reflect intel-ligibility with a <i>Male</i> voice
and the other based on the use of a <i>Female</i> voice.</p>
<p>You may also switch to a STIPa or RaSTI setting to compare with
meas-urement results. Check out the effect of changing these setup parameters
on the STI display.</p>
<p>In addition to these settings, corrections for low
signal-to-noise ratio and for masking of frequency bands can be taken into
account. These parameters for the STI are taken into account ac-cording to the
standard IEC 60268-16 (2003).</p>
<p><img width=456 height=365
src="E4.files/image026.jpg"></p>
<p><b>ALcons%</b></p>
<p><b>Articulation Loss of Consonants</b></p>
<p>ALcons, Articulation Loss of Conso-nants, is another way of
measuring in-telligibility. It measures intelligibility by the percentage of
articulation loss of consonants. The <i>Alcons%</i> for the same Listener Seat
are shown to the right.</p>
<p>Note that we added a tabular listing to the screen by selecting
Combined in the lower left corner of the screen. This al-lows us to read the
exact values at dif-ferent frequency bands. In this case we have Alcons of
3.88%, which is consis-tent with what we would expect from the C50 figures.
Note, however, that it is significantly lower than the result we ob-tained when
we mapped Alcons under Area Mapping.</p>

<p><b>C80 Clarity Measure</b></p>
<p>For the assessment of music, AURA provides the well-known C80
Clarity measure, which belongs to the energy ratios set. It is defined as the
ratio in dB of the energy in the first 80 ms after the first sound arrival to
the energy content arriving after the first 80 ms.</p>
<p>It is not always desirable to have C80 values as high as
possible, because the higher the value of C80 the lower the effect of the
diffuse field, whose exis-tence under proper control is needed in many cases of
music reproduction.</p>
<p>The scale for evaluating the C80 pro-jections is in the Room
Investigations section of this tutorial. In our example, the system would
reproduce the per-cussive instruments especially good.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=361

<p><b>Center Time</b></p>
<p><b>Center Time </b>is a reference value for<b> </b>spatial
impression and clarity. It is de-fined as the ratio between the summed products
of the energy components of the arriving reflections and their corre-sponding
delays to the total energy component. The higher the value, the more spatial is
the acoustic impression.</p>

<p>Except for early reflections, anything above the Red line is
likely to be a prob-lem while anything above the yellow line is marginal. In
our example, the peak be-tween 60 msec and 75 msec doesn't rep-resent a problem
because of the short delay times. In fact, it’s not uncommon as the early
reflections impact upon the tar-get.</p>

<p>This will open the Histogram shown here. As you can see, a
Histogram displays the number of impacts stored in each of the 1 ms wide bins.
The impact display should be both dense and constant during the entire time
frame (1000 ms in this exam-ple). An inadequate number of Particles was used if
the display isn't dense or if it thins out toward the end of the time frame.</p>
<p>The number of impacts stored in each bin is also important. A
good rule of thumb to follow is that on the average each bin should have at
least 10 impacts. If the av-</p>
<p>erage falls much below 10, consideration should be given to
rerunning the calculation with more Particles. If it's below 5, the calculation
should definitely be rerun. You can get a good feel for the average by running
the Cursor across the chart while observing the count in the Cursor readout at
the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Note that when the Particle Loss method is used, some thinning
toward the end of time frame is acceptable as long as only energy ratio
calculations, such as C Measures, will be run. In energy ratio calculations,
only a good impact balance before and after the Split Time needs to be assured.
RT and STI calculations, on the other hand, need a long smooth particle
distribution over time to be accurate.</p>

<p><b>Particle Loss Method</b></p>
<p>We used an <i>Energy Loss</i> simulation in all of our previous
AURA examples. Now let's take a quick look at the faster <i>Particle Loss </i>method.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=358
src="E4.files/image037.jpg"></p>
<p>Return to the <i>Area Mapping</i> window and select <i>Aura</i>
from the <i>Mapping</i> pull down menu. Use all of the same set-tings, except
under the <i>Calculations</i> <i>Tab/Advanced Options </i>switch to<i>
Parti-cle Loss.</i></p>
<p>The first thing you will notice is that the simulation takes far
less time. On our 2.8GHz dual-core machine with 1 MB of RAM less than 30
seconds com-pared to almost 5 minutes for the En-ergy Loss simulation.</p>
<p>The trade off is accuracy. Follow the prompts, do the
Recombination and save the Mapping File. Open the <i>View</i> <i>Calculations </i>window
and click on the<i> Echogram </i>Tab. As can see from the<i> </i>graphic to the
right, the density is far less than it was in the Energy Loss Echogram.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=358
src="E4.files/image038.jpg"></p>
<p>The next logical step is to use the His-togram to see if it
shows a usable simulation. As you can see from the graphic, it doesn't come
close to meet-ing the criteria for a good simulation.</p>

<p>Now, do a new study using <i>High Reso-lution Slow</i>, that is,
506,000 Particles. It<i> </i>will take longer, but still less than it took for
the Energy Loss simulation. The re-sulting Echogram appears to the right.</p>
<p>As you can see, the density has in-creased and is now more
comparable to the one generated by the Energy Loss method. You'll also find
that the other simulations are closer to ones generated from the Energy Loss
simu-lation, but that there still are small dif-ferences.</p>
<p><img width=456 height=358

<p>The Histogram shows you why. You still need to use more

<p><b>Aura-Response</b></p>
<p>AURA Response is used mainly for architectural acoustic
investigations and auralization. Its advanced algorithms allow the creation of
Re-flectograms with larger reflection orders and longer time windows than is
possible with the Mirror Image and Ray Tracing algorithms used by EASE. This
eliminates the need to add a statistical Tail to the Reflectogram and improves
the realism of any auralization.</p>
<p>We will begin our exercise by accessing <i>Calculate AURA
Response</i> under <i>Tools</i>, in either the <i>Area Mapping</i> or <i>Room
Mapping</i> modules.</p>
<p>Note that you have to Activate one of the Audience Areas and
pick a spot in one of the active Audience Areas before you can open <i>Calculate</i>
<i>AURA Response</i>. Go to the Items pull down menu and choose<i> Select
Active/Audience Areas </i>and make your Audience Area selection. Don't<i> </i>worry
about the location, you will have a chance to change it before running the
calculations. If you select <i>Room Mapping</i> as the entry port, you don't
need to pick a spot.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=339
src="E4.files/image041.jpg"></p>
<p>AURA Response opens with the AURA Response Calculation setup
window shown to the right..</p>
<p>As you can see, this setup window gives us the opportunity to
select the Loudspeakers that will be used in the simulation and the results
(files) destination. If we select <i>Probe</i>, the result (files) will be sent
to the Probe and the Probe will open at the completion of the simulation.
Se-lecting <i>EARS</i> will open the File in EARS for further processing.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Only Save To File</i> will save the results as a
Response File that can then be opened at any time in the Main menu by going to
the <i>Calculations </i>pull down menu and selecting<i> Probe Post Processing</i>.</p>
<p>Note the <i>Create BIR File</i> check box. The program can also
create a .bir (Binaural Impulse Response File) for auralization at the same
time it creates the .rsp Response File. Creating both at the same time will
lengthen the calculation time, but only by a small amount.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=339
src="E4.files/image042.jpg"></p>
<p>To reduce the calculation time, we'll use only Loudspeakers S1
&amp; S2 and send the results to the Probe. Normally, of course, we would be
using all of the Loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Press <i>Nex</i>t and the <i>Location</i>s Tab window shown here
will appear.</p>
<p>This setup window lets you choose what locations will be used in
the simulation. Note that you can select both the <i>Walker</i> location and
any combination of the <i>Listener Seats</i> and the program will generate a
Re-sponse File for each location selected. We'll use just a single Listener
Seat, Seat 1, to reduce the calculation time.</p>
<p>A more common practice would be to include all the Listener
Seats, so the Room's performance could be evaluated at a number of locations.</p>
<p>Pressing <i>Next</i> will open the <i>Calculation</i> Tab window
shown at the top of the next page.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Calculation</i> Tab gives you a chance to review and set
a number of essential parameters for the Response File simulation. The basic
parameters are the same as for the AURA Mapping, please refer to the
description above. Under <i>Advanced Options</i> additional largely spe-cific
to the AURA Response calculation settings are available.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=339
src="E4.files/image043.jpg"></p>
<p>In order to understand them better, note that the Response File
Calcu-lation is done in two separate parts (runs). For the early geometric
re-flections having a reflection order up to the cut off order (the first
part), a hybrid Mirror Image method is used. This method uses a ray tracing
algorithm to scan the room for mirror images using a deterministic, non uniform
directional distribution. For the early scattered reflections and the later
reflections (the second part) an energetic ray tracing algorithm with a uniform
density distribution is used. Both parts are finally added to gain the
response.</p>
<p>The essential parameters are:</p>
<p><b>Max. Diameter after 1s [m]:</b></p>
<p>This setting determines the diameter of the counting balloon
after 1 second. It is automatically adjusted when you select the number of <i>Par-ticles
</i>in the<i> Standard Options </i>screen. This particle number is used for<i> </i>both
the first and the second part of the ray tracing. If you want the re-sults for
the early part to be more precise in comparison to the late part, you have to
lower the <i>Max. Diameter</i> setting accordingly.</p>
<p>This parameter can be adjusted according to the room details. In
a room with only a few large walls, a larger value can be chosen. On the other
hand, in a room with many walls which give the room a lot more details, a
smaller number (diameter) is appropriate. A good choice is to use the diameter
of the smallest surface. However, less than 1m (3 Ft.) is usually not really
necessary and more than 5m (15 Ft.) is probably too large.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=339
src="E4.files/image044.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the number of rays is proportional to 1/d <b>2</b>.
In other words doubling the diameter makes this part of the calculation run 4
times faster. For our purpose, the default setting will be sufficient.</p>
<p><b>Cut Off Order:</b></p>
<p><i>Cut Off Order </i>sets the transition reflection
order where the program<i> </i>switches from the hybrid Mirror Image method to
the ray tracing calcu-lation method. No extrapolation is used.</p>
<p>For the second part, the ray tracing calculation, sound
particles are ra-diated with a well defined energy depending on the directivity
of the source. These particles are followed through the room and each time a
reflection takes place at a surface the surface absorption is taken into
account. Finally, if the particle hits a receiver its current energy is added
to a Bin in an Echogram. The Bin is selected according to the source's delay
and the distance travelled by the particle.</p>
<p>The Order should be set depending on the probability of singular
strong or flutter echoes in the room. If all walls are more or less scattering
surfaces, smaller orders can be used. If some walls have a low scattering
coefficient, larger reflection orders should be used</p>
<p>The program will accept settings from 1 to 30 and the default
setting is 10. Usually relatively small Orders (5 to 7) are used for Probe
re-flection studies and higher numbers used if the simulation will be used for
auralization.</p>

per ms that will be used to<i> </i>generate the detailed structure of the late
part in the reflectogram. Set-tings from 10 to 30 are acceptable and the
default setting is 20. We'll use 10.</p>
<p><b>Tail Resolution:</b></p>
<p><i>Tail Resolution </i>defines the time resolution for
the calculation of the tail<i> </i>part by setting the width of the time boxes
(bins) used for the energy distribution of the late part. A range from 1 to 10
is allowed with a de-fault setting of 5. We'll use 5.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p>Auralization is the process of converting the acoustic and
electro-acoustic data generated by EASE into an audio signal that can be heard
and evaluated. It adds subjective listening to the evaluation process.</p>
<p>EARS is a Binaural Auralization program that take into account
both the acoustical properties of the room and the hearing characteristics of
the human head. Binaural auralizations are inherently more realistic than
Monaural auralizations, since Monaural auralizations do not take the
characteristics of human hearing into account.</p>
<p>EARS offers both “Off Line” and “On Line” (Real Time)
auralizations.</p>
<p>&quot;Off Line&quot; binaural auralization signals are produced
&quot;Off Line&quot; and then stored for later replay or listening. Since these
files are quite large, these auralizations are usually limited to relatively
short &quot;sound bites&quot; that are replayed again and again. Eighteen to
twenty second sound bites are typically used, but longer ones are possible.</p>
<p>“On Line” binaural auralizations use LAKE Convolution Filter
software to produce the auralization signal in a continuous or
&quot;ongoing&quot; man-ner that can be heard immediately in what amounts to
&quot;Real Time&quot;. Thus, they are usually referred to as RT auralizations.
Since the aural-izations are heard in &quot;Real Time&quot; and not stored,
there is no limit to their length.</p>
<p>Auralization is a step by step procedure that normally starts
with a Reflectogram created by EASE and ends with the listening experience.</p>
<p>The steps are:</p>
<p>Step 1: Creating the Reflectogram. The Reflectogram represents
the acoustical signature of the room at the point it was taken.</p>
<p>Step 2: Adding a Tail to the Reflectogram. The Tail extends the
Reflectogram and adds realism to the auralization. <b>Note that using</b> <b>AURA
to develop the Reflectogram eliminates this step as it automatically adds a
Tail to the Reflectogram.</b></p>
<p>Step 3: Combining the Reflectogram with the characteristics of
human hearing. This creates the Binaural signal used in the final con-volution.</p>
<p>Step 4: The final convolution and listening experience.</p>
<p><b><i>Step 1: Creating the Reflectogram.</i></b></p>
<p>Since the Reflectogram is the foundation upon which the
auralization is built, having a good one is essential to the production of
accurate, realistic auralizations.</p>
<p><b>Note: AURA with its advanced algorithms and ability to take
advantage of the reduced computing times offered by multi-core processors is
highly recommended for anyone using EARS. It allows the creation of
Reflectrograms with larger reflection orders and longer time windows than is
possible with the Ray Tracing and Mirror Image algorithms used by EASE. AURA
also automati-cally creates the “Tail”, eliminating the need for Step 2, Adding
a Tail to the Reflectogram. AURA also allows the effects of Scat-tering to be
included in the simulation; Ray Tracing and Mirror Image algorithms do not.</b></p>
<p>Ray Tracing Impact studies are the favorite of users who do not
have AURA, since they produce satisfactory Reflectograms in less time than
Mirror Image studies.</p>
<p>Mirror Image Impact studies produce more precise Reflectograms
than Ray Tracing Impacts. However, the longer computation times re-quired by
the Mirror Image method usually make its use impractical in large, complex
rooms.</p>
<p>A normal tendency while creating Reflectograms is to think that
the longer the Time Frame used, the better the results. This isn't necessar-ily
true. It certainly isn't true if the Reflection Order is too low and many of
the rays are cut off by the reflection count before they impact upon the
counting balloon, or if an inadequate number of rays are emitted into the room
to ensure a good study.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>A factor to consider when choosing the Time Frame is that in
most rooms statistical behavior of the reverberations takes over after 180 ms
to 250 ms have elapsed. After this occurs, impacts generated statistically by
adding a statistical &quot;Tail&quot; to the Reflectogram can be used.</p>
<p>Because of the calculation time involved, choose the location
and number of Listener Seats with care. Using a large number of Listener Seats
doesn't make sense unless each one is going to tell you something useful about
the room. You want locations that will provide you with useful simulations.</p>
<p>Because every room is different, there are no hard and fast
rules to generating good reflectograms. However, one way to tell when a
questionable one has been created is the reflection density. As a general rule,
the reflection density in a room increases with time. So, a decreasing density
toward the end of the Reflectogram indi-cates either the number of Rays was
insufficient or the Reflection Order was to low.</p>
<p><img width=330 height=322
src="E4.files/image055.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Computing Protoco</i>l screen that appears at the end of
the cal-culations is a good place to check this. Note that in our example the
Reflection Order count appears to be leveling off at the end, a sign that more
Rays or a higher Reflection Order should probably have been used.</p>
<p>A thinning (lower impact density) should not show up in the
Reflec-togram when you view it using the Probe. If it does, you probably should
rerun the Impact study with more Rays or a higher Reflec-tion Order</p>
<p>Additionally, and as we learned while studying Ray Tracing
Impacts in Advanced Room Investigation, the Ray Tracing Control window</p>
<p>can also be used to tell when a questionable Reflectogram is
being created. If you skipped this section of the Tutorial, please go back to
the Advanced Room Investigation section and review the pages on Ray Tracing
Impacts.</p>
<p>We’ll use the Reflectogram we created in our Ray Tracing Impact
study under Advance Room Investigations for our Auralization exercise. To get
started, open the <i>Ray Tracing</i> module, go to the <i>Rays</i> pull down
menu, select <i>View Impact File</i> and then open the <i>.mpc file</i> we
cre-ated. When the <i>View Impact File</i> dialog window opens, select <i>Invoke
Probe</i>. Be patient, it may take the program a minute or two to de-velop the
Reflectogram.</p>

<p><b>Step 2. Adding a Tail to the Reflectogram (if needed)</b></p>
<p>Note: AURA users do not need to add a Tail if the Response File
was created by AURA. AURA automatically adds the tail, including scat-tered
diffuse and reverberant sound.</p>
<p>In normal rooms the diffuse sound decay starts not later than
250 to 300 msec after direct sound, so Reflection orders of 12 to 15 should be
the maximun used and a statistical tail added to the reflectogram. Generally,
there is no Reflection Order limitation in EASE 4.3 (orders of 50 or more are
possible), only a memory question. The files can easily be 500 Mb or more and
difficult to handle. They also take a long time to calculate. Accordingly, most
users use shorter time frames and lower reflection orders and add a Tail.</p>
<p>There are two ways to add a Tail, <i>Add Random Tail</i> and <i>Add
Predicted Impacts</i>.</p>
<p><b>Adding a Tail with <i>Add Random Tail</i></b></p>
<p>Select <i>Add Random Tail</i> from the <i>Edit</i> pull down
menu. This will introduce the Reverberant Tail setup screen shown below. It
allows you to edit the Tail's characteristics. We'll be returning to this
screen soon to explore its use. So, for now, just click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p><img width=363 height=278
src="E4.files/image057.jpg"></p>
<p>A typical result is shown below.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that the Tail appears to be a little lower in level than
the initial Reflectogram. The default parameters used to generate the Tail were
based on an average of the last 10 impacts and usually needs to be changed.</p>
<p>To correct this, estimate how much lower the level is in dB. You
can do this by using the Level scale on the right side of the Reflectogram or
by repeatedly clicking in the Reflectogram on each side of the Tails junction
with the original Reflectogram and using the dB readouts to estimate the level
difference.</p>
<p>Then return to the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu and select <i>Cut
Random Tail</i> to remove the Tail so you can add a new one.</p>
<p>Next, open the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu again and again select
<i>Add Random Tail</i>. This will open the Reverberant Tail setup window again.
Note that you can change the Tail's Start time, its Length, the Pulse Density,
amplitude variations (Amplitude Noise) and Level (Amplitude Gain).</p>
<p>Most editing of the Tail is done visually, The object is to
create a Tail that closely resembles the starting Reflectogram in density, in
level and in individual pulse variations (spikes and peaks).</p>
<p>To see how this works, change the <i>Amplitude Gain</i> by 10
dB, click on <i>OK</i> or <i>Recompute</i>. EASE will then add a new Random
Tail based on the new parameters. Now, use the Zoom feature to take a closer
look at the pulses on both sides of the junction.</p>
<p>Please repeat the <i>Cut Random Tail</i> and <i>Add Random Tail</i>
procedure until you are satisfied with the results. We ended with a Pulse
Density of 30,000, a 10 dB Gain Increase and a 30 dB Amplitude Noise increase.</p>
<p><img width=532 height=317
src="E4.files/image059.jpg"></p>
<p>As the final step, take a look at the Reflectogram at several
frequencies. What looks good at 1000 Hz may not look quite as good at 400 Hz or
4000 Hz. If this is the case, you may want to revise the Tail again to strike a
compromise that looks best for all frequencies.</p>
<p>When you are satisfied you can either save the result as a
Response File (a .rsp file) or go directly to the Auralization program and
create a Binaural Impulse Response File (a .bir File). If you decide to save
the edited Reflectogram as a Response File, open the <i>File</i> pull down
menu, select <i>Save Response File As</i> and follow the prompts.</p>

<p>Add Predicted Impacts is another method of adding a random tail.

calculates values like Mirror Dimension, Impacts Present and Impacts Missing.

<p>Note that you have the opportunity to enter a new response
length, including the Tail, for the Reflectogram. Let's use 1000 ms.</p>
<p>EASE can calculate the new number of impacts in two ways, one
with a limit to the Pulse Density and the other without a limit. We recom-mend
the default setting which is Limit Pulse Density. The file size can be huge if
the Pulse Density isn't limited.</p>

<p>A good way to compare the two methods of generating a
Reverberant Tail is to calculate the Schroeder RT plots for both methods.</p>
<p>Open the <i>Options</i> menu (hit <i>F9</i>) for the Probe and
open the <i>Schroeder</i> tab. Accept the default settings and click on the <i>Compute</i>
button.</p>
<p>Then activate <i>Draw Schroeder Curve into Reflectogram</i> and
click on <i>Apply</i> or <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>Schroeder plots for both the Random Tail and Predicted Impacts
methods follow. The Random Tail plot is the one on top.</p>
<p>Note that there is a difference in the projected RT time.</p>

<p>When you are satisfied you can either save the result as a
Response File (a .rsp file) or go directly to the Auralization program and
create a Binaural Impulse Response File (a .bir File). If you decide to save
the edited Reflectogram as a Response File, open the <i>File</i> pull down
menu, select <i>Save Response File As</i> and follow the prompts. Note that the
File pull down menu also allows you to save the Reflectogram as a .bir File.</p>

<p><b>Step 3. Combining the Reflectogram with the Characteristics of
Human Hearing</b></p>
<p>To go direct to the Auralization program, open the <i>Tools</i>
pull down menu and select <i>Invoke EARS</i>. The following prompt will appear.</p>
<p><img width=347 height=180
src="E4.files/image063.jpg"></p>
<p>Answering <i>Yes</i> will open a new window asking you to name
the Response File and designate its location. We suggest storing Response Files
with all the other project data, so all the files are in one location.</p>
<p>Approving the name and location by hitting <i>OK</i> will bring
up the Response File summary.</p>
<p><img width=488 height=367
src="E4.files/image064.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to create the Binaural Impulse Response File
that will be used in the auralization. During this operation, the discrete
pulses of the Monaural Response File will be convolved with the characteristics
of the human head to create a Binaural Response File (.bir). FFT (Fast Fourier
Transform) will be used for this. The convolution may take a minute ot two;
exactly how long depends on the size of the Response File and the speed of your
computer.</p>
<p>To start the process, select <i>Make Binaural Response File</i>
from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu.</p>
<p>This will open the Setup menu for the Binaural Impulse Response
(.bir) convolution shown on the next page.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=673 height=374
src="E4.files/image065.jpg"></p>
<p>Your first step should be to review the File name and location
set up for the Output BIR File. We suggest the same name and file location as
the Input RSP. It's nice to have both in the same location.</p>
<p>This menu also gives you the opportunity to turn the Dummy Head
and to choose the head Transfer Function (HRTF) that will be used.</p>
<p>Unless you have a specific reason to use one of the other heads,
we suggest you use the one titled Dummy Head.</p>
<p>The convolution will start when you click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>When the convolution is completed, a Show Filter Info prompt
will appear. Answer <i>Yes</i> and the Show Filter Info window shown below will
appear.</p>
<p><img width=407 height=305

<p><b>Step 4. The Final Convolution</b></p>
<p>Select <i>Auralization</i> from the EARS Module <i>Tools</i>
pull down menu. This will open the EARS Convolver window..</p>
<p><img width=432 height=298
src="E4.files/image067.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that the .bir (Binaural Impulse Response) file we just
created was inserted into the FIR Filter (Finite Impulse Response) field.
Directly below the FIR Filter section is the Input Control section. This
section determines what signal will be used in the auralization. Clicking on
the <i>Disk </i>icon selects the CD Player as the signal source; the File
Folder icon allows you to browse to the dry audiosignal file you want to use in<i>
</i>the auralization. The default signal is the <i>Male Voice.wav</i> file. If
it doesn’t appear in the Input field, browse to it. You’ll find it stored in
the Dry Input Signal Files folder under Ease40Data.</p>
<p>The Output Control section determines the output signal type
that will be generated. Selecting the File Folder will save the signal as a .wav
file for later playback; the Headset icon sends the auralization to your
computer’s sound card for listening over stereo headsets or loud-speakers.</p>
<p>Before we go on, let's take another look at the Binaural
Response File. Open the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and select <i>Show Filter
Info Now</i> to view the file. Note: If your screen looks different than the
one above (the Convolver section on the right side isn't visible) and the <i>Tools</i>
pull down menu isn't active press the <i>Eject</i> button. This will expand the
window and activate the Tools pull down menu. Open it and select <i>Show Filter
Info Now</i>. This will open the Binaural Impulse Response File. Use your left
mouse button to double click on the graphic and<i> </i>view the frequency
representation of the .bir File shown below. Notice the different
characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>Close the Binaural Response File display and return to the EARS
Convolver window. Note the large <i>EARS</i> and <i>Lake Convolver</i> buttons.
These buttons determine the convolution method that will be used. The EARS
button selects the “offline” method which creates a file that can be stored and
replayed. The Lake button activates the “Online” or “Real Time” convolution
method. Both methods use FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for the convolution. The
difference between the two methods is that the RT convolution is ongoing.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the Offline EARS method. Pressing the EARS
button will select the EARS convolver (see below on the left).</p>
<p>The next step is to name the .Wav file that will be created by
the convolution. Select the <i>File</i> icon under <i>Outpu</i>t and insert the
file name and storage location and then <i>Save</i>. Then press <i>Eject</i>
and <i>Go</i>.</p>
<p>The convolution may take a little time, how much time depends
upon the size of the Binaural Response File (.bir) and the length of the .wav
file containing the dry audio signal. Then, EARS will automatically play the
auralization for you and open the control window shown below on the right to
make it easy for you to replay the auralization as many times as you want.</p>
<p><img width=511 height=230
src="E4.files/image069.jpg"></p>
<p>The vertical slide control adjusts the signal level being sent
to your Sound Card (actually the Windows Audio Mixer). When <i>Set Volume to</i>
<i>File Level </i>is activated, the program automatically adjusts the output
signal level to the .WAV file level. This allows you to listen to level<i> </i>variations
between auralizations made in different room locations.</p>
<p>The best way to listen to the Binaural auralizations produced by
EASE is through a pair of good loudspeakers. Place them 2 to 3 feet apart and
then sit directly in front of them at a listening angle of approximately 30
degrees. You want to be close to the loudspeakers to minimize the effect of the
listening room.</p>
<p>The use of loudspeakers introduces a certain amount of
loudspeaker &quot;cross-talk&quot; between the channels into the listening
experience. This can be eliminated by activating the XTC feature using the XTC
check box located under the Output section of the Ears Convolver window. This
introduces the VMax Virtual Home Theater surround sound software into the
playback. Try it. You'll hear the difference.</p>
<p>Note that the XTC feature is available only on EARS. It is not
available on EARS RT.</p>
<p>Stereo headsets can be used, but they aren't recommended because
of their well known loss of localization for on-axis signals. With stereo headsets,
you are unable to distinguish between on-axis signals arriving from the front
and rear.</p>

<p>Before moving on to online (Real Time) auralizations, it should
be noted that the EARS auralization program can be opened from the <i>Main</i>
EASE menu without even opening a project. Opening the <i>Calculations</i> pull
down menu and selecting <i>Invoke EARS</i> or double clicking on the Desktop <i>Auralization</i>

what you want to do.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Auralize File</i> from the same <i>Calculations</i>
pull down menu will take you directly to the auralization Convolver window.
When the Convolver window opens you will notice that no file is loaded in the <i>FIR
Filter</i> section. To load a .bir file (Binaural Impulse File), click on the <i>Add

<p><b>Real Time Auralization</b></p>
<p>Now it's time to use Real Time Auralization.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is set up the Lake Convolver. If
the Convolver window is open, press the big blue <i>Lake</i> button. If the
window is not open, press <i>Eject</i> to open it and then press the <i>Lake</i>
button.</p>
<p><img width=317 height=219
src="E4.files/image075.jpg"></p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to check out the Frame Size
that can be used. It's a function of computer speed and memory. The smaller the
Frame Size we use, the shorter the In/Out Latency (translate into convolution
time or the time the Signal needs to pass through the convolver).</p>
<p>Press the <i>Speed</i> button at the bottom of the window. This
will open the Convolver Speed window.</p>
<p><img width=419 height=202
src="E4.files/image076.jpg"></p>
<p>To test how small a Frame Size we can use, press the Compute All
Times button.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>Chapter 12: Auralization</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E4.files/image001.jpg"></p>
<p>At the conclusion of the calculation, the Time indicated in <i>Needed
Totally</i> should be less than the <i>Available Time</i> listed. If the Needed
Time is greater than the Available Time, a larger Frame Size will have to be
used. If it’s smaller, a shorter time can probably be used.</p>
<p><img width=419 height=202
src="E4.files/image077.jpg"></p>
<p>In our case, we can use a smaller Frame Size. Use the Frame Size
arrows to select a smaller Frame Size and run <i>Compute All Times</i> again.
Note that any yellow numbers that appear in the windows indicate the
performance is marginal; any red numbers mean the setting is unusable.</p>
<p><img width=419 height=202
src="E4.files/image078.jpg"></p>
<p>One word of caution; our experience is that Frame Sizes less
than 1024 may lead to broken/chopped auralizations. As a result, Frame</p>
<p>Sizes smaller than 1024 are not recommended. Don't try to change
the Sampling Rate and the Response Length. As a new user of EARS</p>
<p>consider them as being fixed.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>When you have determined the proper Frame Size you want to use,
press <i>Exit</i>.</p>
<p>EARS does not transfer this setting to the Convolver, so the
next step is to select the correct Frame Size into the Convolver’s Frame field.</p>
<p>Use the drop down arrow.</p>
<p>Now make sure the Convolver Output is set up for Audio. If not,
press the <i>Headset</i> icon in the <i>Output</i> section. The next step is to
make sure the desired .bir (Binaural Impulse Response) filter or filters have
been installed in the FIR folder. For our demonstration, we also want to
install a Unity filter that will allow us to switch &quot;on the fly&quot;
between an auralized signal and an unauralized one. This allows us to compare
the two conditions. Open the Tools pull down menu and select Add Unity Filter.</p>
<p>We also suggest using the <i>Silent When Clipping</i> feature
during the auralization. It eliminates any clipping noise from the playback by
mut-ing the output signal. Open the <i>Utilities</i> pull down menu and click
on <i>Silent When Clipping</i>.</p>
<p>Now, we can select the input source driver. Return to the Main <i>EARS</i>
window and open the Tools pull down menu and select <i>CD Player</i>. Note that
you have two choice. <i>EARS</i> selects its own player; <i>Windows</i> selects
the Windows CD player. We will be using the Windows CD player, so select <i>Windows</i>.
Note that instead of a CD player signal we could also have used a dry *.wav
file.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>Now, we are ready to go. Start the CD player, if it hasn't
already started, make sure <i>Convolve</i> is checked and then press <i>Install
Fir</i> (trans-late into insert the filter). This will activate the <i>Go</i>
button. Press it to start the convolution. The <i>Played</i> readout window
will signal that the convolution has begun by starting to display the elapsed
time.</p>
<p>At this point, signal levels and gain may not be set for optimum
operation. The Lake convolver expects proper gain settings for all its
Fil-ters. If the convolver gain setting are set too low, background noise can
easily become a problem. The best signal to noise ratios are ob-tained when the
gains are as high as possible. But, high gain settings introduce clipping.</p>
<p>EARS has the ability to determine the proper settings, but it
cannot do this without actually doing at least a short convolution. Press the <i>Stop
</i>and<i> Ejec</i>t buttons and then click on<i> Peak Gain </i>to inform the
program you want it to adjust the gain. Then, check<i> Silent When Clipping </i>under
the <i>Utilities</i> pull down menu.</p>
<p>Now, return to the auralization by clicking on <i>Install Fir</i>
and then pressing <i>Go</i>. Initially you may hear nothing or a convoluted
signal (you may have accidentally matched the correct settings) or a brief high
noise level. In the last case, the <i>Silent When Clipping</i> option kicked in
and eliminated the clipping noise.</p>
<p>In all cases it will take a few seconds, possibly as long as 30
seconds or more, for the program to determine the optimum settings based on the
selected sample rate and needed frame size.. Then you’ll hear the noise
disappear. Now press <i>Stop</i> and <i>Eject</i> again and then click on <i>Peak
Gain</i> to adjust the gain to its correct level. Next, return to the
auralization by clicking on <i>Install Fir</i> and then pressing <i>Go</i>.
Listen to the convoluted (auralized) result. Please note that if higher peaks
appear later on in the selection, the initial settings are no longer valid.</p>
<p>At this point you can save the gain settings by going to the <i>Tools</i>
pull down menu and selecting <i>Save FIR Gain</i>. To do this you will have to
stop the convolution and hit the <i>Eject</i> button. Selecting <i>Save FIR
Gain</i> will store the proper gain settings with the FIR file and they will be
called up automatically the next time you use this FIR file. One word of
caution; the gain settings apply only to the CD you have been play-ing and to
the track being played! If you change CD's or play a different track, you will
need to repeat the process.</p>
<p>Note that the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu also includes a <i>Save
All FIR Gains</i> command. This is used when you have a number of FIR files
from different locations within a model and you want to set and save the gain
settings that give you the best performance while maintaining rela-tive levels.
You need to establish the gain settings for each FIR File and then activate <i>Save
all FIR Gains</i>. The program will take it from there.</p>
<p>You can also manually adjust the Gain settings for the best
performance by inserting Gain figures into the <i>Convolver Gain</i> field and
adjust-ing the output level of your Windows Mixer. It takes a little experimenting,
but it's usually not too hard to find a combination of settings that complement
each other.</p>

<p><b>Section 13: IR Infrared</b></p>
<p>The IR Infrared module allows the performance of Infrared
systems to be simulated and analyzed in much the same fashion as Loud-speaker
systems and their performance are simulated and analyzed.</p>
<p>We will use the AURA1 room model as our room model. You will
find it in the Projects 40 folder under EASE40 Data. It's identified as AURA1.
Open the model and then select <i>Project Data</i> from the <i>Edi</i>t pull
down menu.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=315
src="E4.files/image081.jpg"></p>
<p>Our first step will be to add the IR Emitters to the model.
First, though, a few words about IR Emitters. An IR Emitter consists of a
Modula-tor and a Radiator.</p>
<p><b>Modulators </b>determine the type of transmission (broad
band or narrow band), the carrier frequency and the number of channels.</p>
<p><b>Radiators </b>determine the coverage pattern and signal
level.</p>
<p>Modulators and Radiators may be packaged as two separate devices
or combined into a single unit. EASE, however, manages the data of modulators,
radiators and combined units as separate files.</p>
<p>IR Emitters are inserted into a model in the same fashion as
Loudspeakers, but the rules for placement are different. Infrared is strictly
line-of-sight transmission between the Radiator and the Receiver(s). Typically
Radiators are mounted as high as possible to prevent obstruc-tions, such as
those seated in the row ahead of the listener, from interfering with the
transmission. When more than one Radiatior is needed to provide adequate
coverage, it's common to split them (place them a distance apart) and
cross-fire the signal. This improves the likelihood that the signal from at
least one of the Radiators will reach the Receiver.</p>
<p>The interference caused by cross-firing and overlapping coverage
has a positive effect in Infrared systems and not a negative effect as it
usually has in loudspeaker systems.</p>
<p><b>Inserting IR Emitters</b></p>
<p>To insert an IR Emitter click on the <i>Insert IR Emitter</i>
button in the Tool Bar or go to the <i>Insert</i> pull down menu and click on <i>IR
Emitter</i>. Then, click on any spot in the room. This will open the IR Emitter
Properties window shown at the top of the next page.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>Chapter 13: IR Infrared</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=286
src="E4.files/image082.jpg"></p>
<p>The first step is to correct the location of the Emitter by
entering the correct x, y, z coor-dinates under Location. Let's assume that our
plan is to install two Emitters, one on each side of the stage and fairly close
to the ceiling. Enter -31 as the x coordinate, 10 for y and 35 for z.</p>
<p>Note that if we knew the aiming angles, we could enter them
under View Angle. We don't know them, so we'll wait and use the Aiming feature
after we have finished defin-ing the Emitter.</p>
<p>The next step is to assign the corresponding devices (
Modulators and Radiators) to the IR Emitter. We'll start with the Modulator.
which determines the carrier frequency of the signal transmission as well as
the number of transmission channels. Click on the <i>[.]</i> button to the
right of the Modulator Model text field to open the Choose Modulator win-dow.</p>
<p><img width=218 height=264

<p>Click on <i>Browse</i> and use conventional browsing techniques
to locate the E<i>ASE40Data/</i> <i>IR Devices/IR Sennheiser </i>folder. Open
it, click on<i> Select All</i>, then<i> Add&gt;&gt; </i>and then press<i> OK</i>.</p>
<p>This will return you to the Choose Modulator window. Let's use
the Sennheiser SI1015, a broad-band, two-channel modulator. It will give us
full range, 20 Hz to 20 kHz stereo performance. Narrow-band, multiple channel
modulators are used mainly for speech in simultaneous interpretation systems.</p>
<p>Select the <i>SI1015</i> and click on <i>OK</i>. Next, click on <i>Select</i>
in the Modulator section of the Properties window and select both frequencies.
We want to reproduce a stereo signal, so we'll need to use both channels.</p>
<p><img width=216 height=262
src="E4.files/image084.jpg"></p>
<p>Follow the same procedure to assign the IR Radiator, but be sure
to use only a Radiator that is compatible with the SI1015 Modulator. We'll use
the SZI1029.</p>
<p>The cable length between the Modulator and Radiator is important
when the Radiator is at a great distance from the Modulator and when multiple
Radiators are used and the cable lengths vary. For this exercise, let's assume
the lengths will be the same for both Radiators and enter 50 in the <i>Cable
Length</i> field. Click on <i>OK</i> to accept the settings and close the

<p>The AURA1 model we chose to use was not in the Symmetrical
modeling mode so only one IR Emitter was placed in the model. We also know from
earlier Tutorial lessons that it’s not a good idea to try to go back to the
Symmetrical modeling mode once you have exited it. So, follow the same
procedure to insert the second Emitter or use Duplicate/Displace to insert it
and then displace it by 62 feet. Pick the first Emitter and then right click on
the screen to open the Mouse menu, select <i>Duplicate</i> and then insert 62
in the x field of the Displace screen.</p>
<p>Now, lets aim the Radiator portion of the Emitter. Pick it, if
it isn't selected, and then right click to open the Mouse Menu. Select IR
Emitter Aiming and the Aiming screen shown below will appear. Just click on the
screen to reaim the Radiator. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Notice that the Horizontal and Vertical aiming angles are
displayed at the bottom of the screen. Make note of these as you'll want the
sec-ond Radiator aimed to the same spot on the other side of the room. Hint; we
ended up with 50 degrees horizontal and -25 degrees vertical for IR1.</p>

<p>Then repeat the procedure with IR2.</p>
<p><b>Calculations</b></p>
<p>Now its time to see how the system performs. Ease allows you to
calculate an IR signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio in dB) for each channel as a
function of distance and carrier frequency for Listener Seats and Audience
Areas under Area Mapping and for Listener Seats, Audience Areas and Faces under
Room Mapping. Interference and shadowing effects can be included in the
simulation.</p>
<p>Reflections are not included and the simulation will be made with
only direct radiation considered. Reflections are not included since
insuf-ficient data exists on the Infrared reflection characteristics of of
surface materials. Fortunately, reflections improve the signal-to-noise ratio
which makes the simulation results conservative.</p>

<p>The mapping routine for IR simulations is very similar to the
routine used for Loudspeakers. Press <i>F5</i> to <i>Check Data</i> and then
switch to the Ease Main Window and open the <i>Area Mapping</i> module. (Click
on <i>Area Mapping</i> in the <i>Calculations</i> pull down menu.)</p>
<p>When the Area Mapping window opens, the first thing you will
notice is that the Main floor Audience Area is obscuring the Balcony Audi-ence
Area. The designer forgot to move one of the Audience Areas so this wouldn't
happen. No problem, return to the Edit Project module and select <i>Area Layou</i>t
from the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu. Then select <i>Move</i> from the <i>Edit</i>
pull down menu and grab the Main Floor Audience Area and move it out of the
way.</p>
<p>Return to the Area Mapping window and click on <i>IR Simulation</i>
in the <i>Mapping</i> pull down menu and the first of three IR Simulation
dialog windows will open.shown below will open.</p>
<p><img width=282 height=237
src="E4.files/image086.jpg"></p>
<p>Select the IR Emitters that will be used in the calculation by
clicking on the IR Emitter button and then selecting both IR Emitters.</p>
<p>You will probably also want to reduce the patch Size; change it
from 3.28 to 1.</p>
<p>Then press the <i>Next</i> button to move to the second
(Set-tings) tab.</p>
<p><img width=282 height=237
src="E4.files/image087.jpg"></p>
<p>The Settings tab determine which Audience Areas or Listener
Seats will be included in the simulation. Select both Audience Areas and then
press the <i>Next</i> button to move to the third (Calculations) tab.</p>
<p><img width=282 height=237
src="E4.files/image088.jpg"></p>
<p>Make sure both the <i>Interference Sum</i> and <i>Map with</i> <i>Shadow
</i>boxes are checked. We do want to take interfer-ence and shadowing into
account in our simulation.</p>

<p>Notice that we did not insert a Noise Level figure in the <i>Noise
Level [dB]</i> field. Little data exists on how the two primary types of
interfer-ence affect the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Unmodulated
Interference, such as the interference caused by daylight and stage lighting
which have their own Infrared component, can wash out the signal.</p>
<p>Modulated Interference, the interference caused by light
dimmers, fluorescent light and electronic ballasts introduce buzz and static
into the system.</p>
<p>The Noise Level [dB] field was included so that when data
becomes available it can be entered into the program and included in the
signal-to-noise calculation.</p>
<p>When you are ready to start the simulation, click on <i>OK</i>.
When the View Calculation Window opens minimize it so you can see the map-ping
display.</p>
<p><img width=505 height=316
src="E4.files/image089.jpg"></p>
<p>As a general rule, ratios of 50 dB or higher are considered
good; levels of 40 dB to 50 dB are marginal and lower levels are probably not
acceptable.</p>
<p>Our map dips below below 50 in the corners of the balcony, so
lets try reaiming the Emitters.</p>
<p>Return to Edit Project and change the vertical aiming angles on
the two IR Emitters from -25 to -20. <i>Check Data [F5]</i> and then return to
the Mapping window. Click on <i>Acquire Project Data</i> in the <i>File</i>
pull down menu and answer <i>Yes</i> to the prompts that appear to rerun the
simula-tion. You will see that this improved the performance.</p>
<p>To try other aiming angles return to the Edit Project window,
change the aiming angles, Check Data and then return to the Mapping mod-ule.</p>
<p>We tried again and ended up using 45 for the Horizontal angle
and -18 for the Vertical Angle.The result appears at the top of the next page.</p>
<p>Note that now the coverage is above 50 throughout the Audience
Areas.</p>

<p>We touched earlier on the importance of cable length. Let's
explore this further by adding 100 feet to the length of the cable to one of
the Radiators.</p>
<p>Return to the Edit Project window, select one of the IR Emitters
and then right click to open the Mouse Menu. Open the Properties folder and
increase the cable length by 100 feet. Click on <i>OK</i> and then press <i>F5</i>
to Check Data.</p>
<p>Return to the Area Mapping window, click on <i>Acquire Project
Data</i> in the and follow the prompts to rerun the simulation.</p>
<p>As you can see, cable length is important.</p>

<p><b>Creating New IR Devices</b></p>
<p>Adding new IR devices to the IR database file is a relatively
simple procedure.</p>
<p>To establish new IR modulator and IR radiator files go to the <i>File</i>
pull down menu in the Ease Main win-dow. Then click on <i>IR Sources</i> in the
Main Data Bases submenu. This will open the IR Base module.</p>
<p>To add a new IR device, select <i>New</i> <i>Device </i>from the<i>
File </i>pull down<i> </i>menu.</p>
<p>This will open a Create New Device dialog box.</p>
<p><img width=248 height=240
src="E4.files/image093.jpg"></p>
<p>Choose the type of device (Radiator, Modulator or
Modulator/Radiator Combined ) and then click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p><b>Radiators</b></p>
<p>We'll start with a Radiator, so put a check in the radio button
in front of <i>Radiator </i>and hit<i> OK</i>.</p>
<p>Now, open the Edit pull down menu. You'll see that only three of
the five selections are active, Radiator Model, Radiator Data and Attenua-tion
Data. If we had checked Modu-lator in the previous operation, only Modulator
Model, Modulator Data and Attenuation would be active. Selecting
Modulator/Radiator Com-bined would have turned all five items active.</p>
<p><img width=202 height=313
src="E4.files/image094.jpg"></p>
<p>We'll start by selecting <i>Radiator</i></p>
<p><i>Model. </i>This will open the screen</p>
<p>shown to the right.</p>
<p>Enter the model number of the de-vice in the Radiator Model
field and the name of the manufacturer in the Manufacturer field. Note that if
we were entering a combined Radia-tor/Modulator it would be necessary to check <i>Modulator
Integrated</i>. Click on <i>OK</i> to confirm the data and close the window.</p>
<p>280</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>Now return to the Edit pull down menu and select <i>Radiator
Data</i>. This will open</p>
<p><img width=266 height=402
src="E4.files/image095.jpg"></p>
<p>the Radiator Data screen.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The only Radiator Data parameter that is actually needed by the
program to complete the simulation calculations is the number of IR diodes. All
the other data is included only for information. Enter the number of diodes in
the <i>IR</i> <i>Diodes Number </i>field</p>
<p>After you have finished entering the data, click on <i>Compute
Sensitivity [dB]</i> to initiate the calculation of a characteristic radiation
level.</p>
<p>This is the level of the signal-to-noise ratio at a distance of
1 m without consid-eration of the directivity characteristic. The
characteristic radiation level is calcu-lated according to:</p>
<p><img width=241 height=111
src="E4.files/image096.jpg"></p>
<p>n<sub>D</sub> = number of diodes</p>
<p>L<sub>D</sub> = diode capacity</p>
<p>0,2141 sr Radiation angle = +/- 15 °</p>
<p><img width=22 height=34
src="E4.files/image097.jpg"></p>
<p>Correction factor for the diode capacity, the specified value is
for a supply with 100 mA c.a.</p>
<p>The actual supply, however, is with 90 mA c.a. (in devices of
the Sennheiser Company)</p>
<p>Note that the radiation capacity of the diode is not variable
and is fixed at 15 mW (according to the the specifications of the diodes used
by Sennheiser in their IR devices) .The set-up for level calculation was
derived from the available measured data. Click on <i>OK</i> to confirm the
data and close the window.</p>
<p><img width=324 height=303
src="E4.files/image098.jpg"></p>
<p>Now click on <i>Attenuation Data</i> in the <i>Edit</i> menu to
open the Attenua-tion Data window. The table contained in the window is used to
enter the directional attenuation data of the radiator. All values are in the
minus dB scale (level of signal-to-noise ratio). The level at 0.0 degree
(normally the main axis) is normalized with 0 dB and all other meas-urements
are derived from this point. However, the numbers may be entered without a
minus sign as the program assumes that all attenu-ation values are negative.</p>
<p>The chart shows the polars in line values from 0 degree to 180
de-grees. 0 is on the axis in front of the radiator and 180 is looking at the
rear of the radiator. Visualize this as a wedge or a slice of an orange. The
column angles from 0 degree to 355 degrees take the slice and tilt it 5
degrees. 0 degree corresponds to the left half of the horizontal polars and 180
to the right half. At 90 degrees the visible half of the polars corresponds to
the upper vertical half and at 270 degrees we see the lower vertical half.</p>
<p>It is also possible to enter only the horizontal and vertical
polar data. Enter the data, then select <i>Compute Elliptical Lobe</i> from the
<i>Data</i> pull down menu. EASE will then calculate all the other data points
by means of an elliptical lobe algorithm.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Apply</i> in the Data window will store the Data. <i>Exit</i>
will store the Data and close the window.</p>

<p>Now click on <i>Modulator Model</i> in the <i>Edit</i> menu to
open the Modulator Model window.</p>
<p>Notice that this window is similar to the Radiator Model window.
Enter the manufacturer's name and the model number and, if you are entering a
combined Radiator/Modulator check <i>Radiator Integrated</i>. Then click on <i>OK
</i>to confirm the data and close the window.</p>
<p>Next, click on <i>Modulator Data</i> in the Edit menu, and the
Modulator Data window will open.</p>
<p>The program actually needs only the four following parameters
for its simulations. The other data is included only for information.</p>
<p>-the type of modulation, broad band (wide) or narrow band (narrow)
Note that narrow band modulation is usually used only for multi-channel
systems, such as those used for simultaneous interpreta-tion systems.</p>
<p>-the maximum carrier frequency (Max. RF Channel)</p>
<p><img width=238 height=355
src="E4.files/image100.jpg"></p>
<p>-the minimum carrier frequency (Min. RF Channel)</p>
<p>-and the number of channels (RF Channels Number)</p>
<p>Notice that the program will allow only two wide band channels.</p>
<p>Click on <i>OK</i> to confirm the data and close the window.</p>
<p>The last step is to save and store the entered data in the Ease
IR Radia-tor/Modulator files.</p>
<p>Click on <i>Save Device As</i> in the File menu of the IR Base
main window.</p>
<p>The dialog box that pops up shows the name of the device as a
standard file name.</p>
<p>The radiator data and the
modulator data are stored in files with the ex-tensions .irr and .irm,
respectively. With combined units, only the name of the radiator file is given.
The modulator file is stored under the same name</p>
