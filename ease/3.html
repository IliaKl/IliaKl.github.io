<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><b>Naming a Project</b></p>
<p>Now it is time to begin a new project. Open EASE and either
select the <i>File</i> pull down menu in the Main menu bar and choose <i>New</i>
<i>Projec</i>t or use the Desk Top icons (<i>Start working/Create
Project/Create Empty Project</i>). Either method will open the Project Options
win-dow shown below.</p>
<p>We will be doing several tutorial models and it would be nice to
have them stored in the same &quot;Tutorial&quot; folder. To accomplish this,
insert &quot;Tutorial&quot; in the Hall field. Then insert &quot;Model_1&quot;,
the name of the room we will be building, in the <i>Project File Name</i>
field. This will create a Tutorial folder in the location shown in the Project
Path field and store all the files we will be creating in that folder as
Model_1.</p>
<p>Note that in the window shown below the files are being saved in
the Documents and Settings directory on the computers C: drive, the MS
recommended location.</p>
<p><img width=535 height=451
src="E1.files/image054.jpg"></p>
<p>Let's accept the default settings for the Default Data Folders
by making no changes in this section of the window and clicking on <i>Create.</i></p>
<p>This will bring up the prompt shown below.</p>
<p><img width=355 height=134
src="E1.files/image055.jpg"></p>
<p>Press <i>OK</i> and the folder will be created.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>.Now, go to the <i>Edit</i> pull down menu and select <i>Project
Data</i> or use the desktop Room Edit/Edit Data icons to open the blank Edit
Project window shown below.</p>
<p><img width=538 height=390
src="E1.files/image056.jpg"></p>
<p><b>It is important to note at this point that any work done on a
project under Edit Project will not be saved unless the changes are first
checked under Edit Project, which automatically sends the changes to the Main
program and then saved in the EASE Main program. This is where the <i>F6 Apply
and Save</i> key command comes into play. It checks the data, sends the changes
to the EASE Main program and saves them to protect against your work being lost
if you inadvertently exit the program.</b></p>
<p><img width=301 height=352
src="E1.files/image057.jpg"></p>
<p>Before we actually start to build the model there are several
setup parame-ters we should check. Right click on the blank screen to open the
Mouse Menu. Then select <i>Room Data</i> to open the Edit Room Data window.
Open the <i>Data</i> tab. Then type in the project's name (Model_1) in the <i>Project
Ver-sion </i>field, its location in the<i> Town </i>field and add any notes
concerning the<i> </i>project you would like to store with it.</p>
<p>We should note here that the Hall name would be the same as the
Project Version name, if only one project was going to be stored in the
Tutorial folder. But, we wanted to provide for storing several models in the
Tutorial folder. Hence, the names are different. Both names can be as long as
40 characters.</p>
<p>Next, make sure the <i>Room Open</i> and <i>Room Symmetric</i>
boxes are checked. Room modeling is normally done in the Room Open mode, since
when the Room is Closed (not open) the program expects the room to be complete
and routinely checks for Holes, missing Faces, Non-Planar Faces, etc. whenever
you check data or exit the program. This generates numerous Error Messages when
the model is under construction and many elements are missing.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The way to prevent most of these messages is to do the modeling
in the Room Open mode and then “Close” the Room after it is complete. In the
Room Open mode, the program mainly checks for Non-Planar Faces (Faces that are
not flat). When the Room is Closed, the Check Data operation is far more
detailed.</p>
<p>When the Room Symmetric mode is on during room modeling, EASE
will automatically add mirror image Vertices, Edges, Faces, Loud-speakers,
Audience Areas, Listener Seats, Lamps and IR Devices . This cuts the modeling
time in half as you only have to model one side of the room; EASE puts in the
other side for you. It is common practice to first model all symmetrical
aspects of the room while in the Room Symmetric mode and then switch to the
Non-Symmetric mode to add any non-symmetrical items.</p>
<p>We’ll look into the Mapping and Settings tabs later. For now,
the changes we made are sufficient. Click <i>OK</i> to approve the changes.</p>
<p><b>Loading Loudspeaker and</b></p>
<p><img width=385 height=289
src="E1.files/image058.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Wall Material Databases.</b></p>
<p>Now would be a good time to become familiar with the Speaker and
Wall Material databases.</p>
<p>We don’t need to load the Wall Materials and Loud-speakers we
will be using in this project at this time, since we’ll have the opportunity to
load them individu-ally as we construct the model and add Walls (Faces) and
Loudspeakers (Speakers) to the Room. However, before we start the Model we
should have a good idea of what Wall Materials are used in the Room and what
Loudspeakers we would like to try out to see how well they will perform, and
it’s usually more efficient to build the project’s data base at this time.</p>
<p>In the Edit Project window select <i>Select Project
Data-base/Select Speaker Models </i>from the<i> Edit </i>pull down<i> </i>menu.</p>
<p>When the Select Project Database/Speaker Models window opens,
browse to <i>EASE40Data/Global Speak-ers40/ </i>and the Manufacturer whose
loudspeaker(s)<i> </i>you intend to use.</p>
<p><img width=342 height=289
src="E1.files/image059.jpg"></p>
<p>Select a loudspeaker model and press <i>Add&gt;&gt;</i> to load
the Loudspeaker into the Project Database. Repeat the process until you have
selected all the loudspeakers you plan to use in the project. Note that you can
select multiple loudspeakers at the same time by holding down the left mouse
button and scrolling or by holding down the <i>Ctr</i>l key while selecting
different loudspeak-ers.</p>
<p>Then press <i>Select All</i> in the Project Database side of the
window and press <i>Close</i> to exit the database.</p>
<p>We will be using the Renkus-Heinz STX4/94 in our ex-ercise, but
feel free to use other loudspeaker(s) if you want.</p>

<p>Follow the same procedure for Wall Materials only start by
selecting <i>Select Project Database/Select Wall Materials</i> from the <i>Edit</i>
pull down menu.</p>
<p>A listing of the Wall Materials we will be using in this
exer-cise can be found on page 48. The window to the right shows them inserted
into the database.</p>
<p>Similar procedures are used to load Bulbs, Textures and IR
Devices into the Project Database.</p>
<p><b>Printing the Wall Material Database</b></p>
<p>The Wall Material abbreviations can be a little difficult to
translate until you become familiar with them. Many users have found that
having a printed copy of the complete Wall Material database makes finding and
selecting the right material much easier and faster</p>
<p>To print a copy go to the <i>Main Ease</i> window and use the <i>File</i>
pull down menu to open the IMEX Import/Export program module. When the IMEX
program opens select <i>Full Wall Material Inventory</i> from the the <i>Edit</i>
pull down menu.</p>
<p><img width=429 height=326
src="E1.files/image061.jpg"></p>
<p>This will open a detailed listing of all the Wall Materials
(refer to the graphic on next page). To print the list select <i>Print File</i>
from the <i>File</i> pull down menu.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=348
src="E1.files/image062.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Room Modeling Techniques</b></p>
<p>One of the first steps in modeling any room is to form a clear
picture of the room, either on paper or in your mind. A few minutes studying
the information you have to work with and sketching the room can save you hours
of modeling time. EASE offers several methods of mod-eling a room and deciding
what method to use is an important decision. You need to have a clear idea of
how you are going to proceed be-fore you start.</p>
<p>The Prototype method is based on the use of pre-built prototype
rooms that can be easily resized and otherwise modified. This method is a great
time saver, when your room is similar to one of the Prototypes. We’ll
investigate the use of Prototypes later.</p>
<p>EASE also has the ability to create a number of complex shapes,
such as cubes, domes, cylinders and pyramids. If your room has curved surfaces
or includes columns, you'll want to consider using Create Shapes as a means of
reducing the modeling time. Examples of the use of Create Shapes in
constructing complex rooms can be found starting on page 106.</p>
<p>If the room you are about to model is similar to one you have
done before, saving the existing room under another name using the Save As
command and then modifying it is another possible way to save time.</p>
<p>You can also import 3-D models from Sketchup or AutoCad into
your project and use them as the basis for your model.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, the model can be built point by point
(Vertex by Vertex) and Face by Face until it is completed using x, y, z
coordinates. It's also possible to start with one method, Prototypes for
example, and then add unusual features with Create Shapes and finish the model
using the x, y, z coordinate method.</p>
<p>Your choice will depend upon how close one of the prototypes or
existing rooms is to the new room and on how detailed a model is needed. In the
early stages of a project, for example, only a quick look at the direct sound
coverage offered by the loudspeaker system being considered may be needed. This
doesn't require a detailed model.</p>
<p>Another consideration is who will be looking at the printouts.
There is no reason to spend a lot of time including in your model minute room
details like doors and windows that usually don't materially affect the overall
acoustics, unless you want to impress a client with a nice looking model.
Another factor to consider is whether or not the room is symmetrical. If it is,
the EASE symmetry feature can cut your modeling time in half. You enter an item
on one side of the room and EASE will place an identical one on the other side
of the room.</p>
<p>Since the x, y, z coordinate method is used to modify the rooms
in the other methods, we will use this procedure to construct our first</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>In the X, Y, Z coordinate method each surface area (called a
Face in the program) is constructed by connecting together the points
(Ver-tices) which outline its area. The points (Vertices) are identified by
their location in the x, y, z coordinate system. The 3D drawing of a 2 foot
square cube shown below illustrates the coordinate system.</p>
<p><img width=455 height=326
src="E1.files/image063.jpg"></p>
<p>The graphic below shows how the cube drawing will appear in
EASE. Note the red, blue and green x, y, z axis lines and the red dots which
identify the corner points (Vertices).</p>
<p><img width=454 height=284
src="E1.files/image064.jpg"></p>
<p>The plane of symmetry for data input in EASE can be any plane
parallel to the yz plane. All values of x are possible, including x = 0, which
is used in the illustration. When the Symmetry option is on, all items
(Vertices, Edges and Faces) entered in the negative x part of the Room will
automatically be mirrored (entered into the program) in the positive x part of
the Room. The reverse also holds true; items en-tered in the positive x part of
the Room will be mirrored in the negative x part.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Room Entry</b></p>
<p>Many experienced users begin a project by using a red pencil to
draw in the x, y, z axis and the 0, 0, 0 point on a sketch of the room or on
the room drawings (blue prints). They then proceed to identify (circle in red)
the points they want to include in their drawing and write their coordinate
locations on the drawing. At the same time, they decide exactly how they are
going to proceed; for example, exactly where they will start their model.</p>
<p>Now, it's time to create a room model. A sketch of the room we
will be modeling appears below. The coordinates for the Vertices are shown to
help you get started.</p>
<p><img width=671 height=402
src="E1.files/image065.jpg"></p>
<p>Our sample room is 75 feet long and 50 feet wide. Its walls are
12 feet high and the overall height of the room at the peak of the roof is 25
feet.. Note that the unit of measurement is feet. The stage (Chancel) is
elevated 2 feet above the main floor and is reached by two steps that are 12
inches high and 12 inches deep. The shaded areas represent the seating areas.</p>
<p>We want the seating areas to be separate Faces, as this will
allow us to easily change their acoustical properties to represent different
size audiences. We'll use PUBINWDP to represent the congregation seated in pews
and MTSEATWD to represent empty seats. It will also make adding Audience Areas
easier when we reach that part of constructing a model.</p>
<p>The floors are covered with a commercial grade carpet
(CARPTCOMM), three of the walls are painted brick (PNTD BRICK), the wall
be-hind the stage is smooth plaster (PLAST/LTHS) and the ceiling (roof) and
peaks are wood paneling (WOODFLR).</p>
<p>The shaded seating areas in our tutorial room could be modeled into
the floor, but this a lot more difficult than simply pasting (in EASE
ter-minology &quot;Coating&quot;) them onto the floor after the room is built.</p>
<p>You may want to copy this page, so you'll have it ready for easy
reference as you construct the model.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The completed model as it will appear in EASE is shown below.</p>
<p>We could easily model this room using either the Church(A)
prototype or the Auditory w/Peaked Roof prototype. We could also model it using
Create Shapes by first creating a Cuboid the size of the room and then adding
the roof as a Pyramid. Both approaches would quickly give us models almost
identical to the sample room and needing only a few modifications to become
identical.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E1.files/image066.jpg"></p>
<p>The Church(A) room, for example, has a two foot high Chancel
(stage), but no steps (refer to the drawing below). The steps would have to be
added for the two rooms to be identical. While considering this you would have
to ask yourself how important the steps are acousti-cally.</p>
<p>Additionally, both the front and rear walls are drawn as a
single entity and would have to redrawn as two Faces since the wall materials
are different. The seating areas would also have to be added. None of these
changes are a big deal once you have mastered the art of room modeling and an
experienced user could easily make the changes in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=292
src="E1.files/image067.jpg"></p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The <i>Auditory w/Peaked Roo</i>f prototype (see below) is very
similar to <i>Church(A)</i>. The main difference is that the Chancel area,
although drawn in as a separate area, is not elevated two feet. It's at floor
level. This room, too, could be easily converted into a room identical to the
drawing.</p>
<p><img width=534 height=333
src="E1.files/image068.jpg"></p>
<p>Since modifying these rooms requires knowledge of the coordinate
system and EASE modeling techniques, we will first model the room using the
coordinate method.</p>
<p>Most EASE users model a room in the same order it would be
physically built; i.e., they first model the floor, then they erect the walls
and after that add the ceiling/roof. The final step is to put in the finishing
touches, such as the seating areas, windows and doors. Other users leave the
ceiling (roof) to last. It is up to you.</p>
<p>We will be doing most of our modeling using the 3-D view.
Experienced 3-D CAD users may feel more comfortable using the OmniView window
which lends itself to more graphic modeling techniques. We’ll try this out
later.</p>
<p><b>Edit Project Options</b></p>
<p><img width=312 height=260
src="E1.files/image069.jpg"></p>
<p>Before we start the drawing, let's check the Option settings to
get a feeling for the many options available to you and to make sure they are
set the way you would like to have them set. Select <i>Options</i> from the <i>File
</i>pull down menu or use the Options icon in the Tool Bar section or<i> </i>the
F9 hot key to open the Options folder.</p>
<p>In the <i>Genera</i>l tab (see next page) change the Background
color from gray to white. Use the .button next to the Background color field
to open the color selector. Select white or any color you would like to use and
then use <i>Apply</i> to look at the difference in the drawing and then go back
to gray. Some users like to switch to white before printing as it re-duces the
printing time, because the printer doesn't have to spend time printing the gray
background. You can choose any color you like. Make your choice and then press <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, open the <i>View</i> tab. Note that in the <i>Redraw</i>
section, both <i>While</i> <i>Scrolling </i>and<i> While Dragging </i>are<i> </i>checked.
This allows you to see how far you have moved the model while you are scrolling
or dragging it across the screen. Unless they are checked, you won't know how
far you have moved the model until you stop. You may want to use <i>Apply </i>to
see the difference.</p>
<p><img width=478 height=876
src="E1.files/image070.jpg"></p>
<p>Under <i>Auto Refit</i>, we suggest mak-ing sure the <i>Full
after Resize</i> box is checked. Otherwise, whenever you open the Room Editor
module and Maximize the screen, the room model will need to be resized
man-ually using the Full icon.</p>
<p>If the <i>Full after Turn</i> and <i>Full after View</i> boxes
are checked, when-ever you Zoom in on a section of the model and then either
turn the model or change the view to get an</p>
<p>even better look, the model will re-vert to its full size.
You'll have to de-cide how you want this portion of the program to work.</p>
<p>You may want to change the Axes Length. All we want is an icon
on the screen to keep us oriented. We don't need ones that are several hundred
feet long. If you want, change them to a more reasonable length, 10 or 20 feet
for example, and hit <i>Apply</i>.</p>
<p>Next, open the <i>Pick</i> tab and make sure that at least the <i>Vertices
of</i> <i>Picked Face </i>option is checked<i> </i>under <i>Highlight Item</i>.
Hit <i>Apply</i>.</p>
<p>Now open the <i>Prompts</i> tab and under <i>Insert Face - Add
Vertex</i> change the selection to <i>Never Add Vertex</i>. This change
prevents the inadver-tent adding of Vertices while adding a Face. Hit <i>Apply.</i></p>
<p>Next, let's change the <i>Step Width</i> under the <i>Editing</i>
tab to a much smaller value (if you will be modeling in feet, .03 feet for
example.) The smaller value is useful when you are using the arrow keys to
position two loudspeakers side by side. Hit <i>Apply</i>.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>And finally, open the <i>Grid</i> tab and make sure everything
under <i>Snap To</i> <i>Grid </i>is selected and the<i> Snap Resolution </i>is
set to a smaller value (0.5<i> </i>feet is recommended). These changes will
make it easier to fully utilize the graphic drawing capabilities of EASE. Then,
approve all the selec-tions you have made in the Options folder by clicking on <i>OK</i>
and return to the Edit Project window.</p>
<p><img width=312 height=260
src="E1.files/image071.jpg"></p>
<p>Before we start, let's do one more thing. Right click on the
screen to open the Mouse Menu and then select Grid. Notice that this takes you
directly to the Grid tab in the Options folder. This time in the Single View
Grid section, put a check in the <i>Z-Grid</i> box and then hit Apply.</p>
<p>Note that a Grid has now been added to the screen. Many users
like to do their modeling with this Grid turned On as it helps them keep their
perspective. The choice of using it or not is up to you. If you want to use it,
hit <i>OK</i>. If not, remove the check in the Z-Grid box and then click on <i>OK</i>.</p>
<p><img width=673 height=488
src="E1.files/image072.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, open the Mouse Menu again. Notice that it also includes
Stepwidth and xz-Plane Value listings. Both of these take you directly to
Editing tab in the Options folder to make it easy to change them.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Entering Vertices</b></p>
<p>The Vertices we will be using to construct our room have been
circled in our Tutorial room drawing and coordinates for most of the Vertices
are given. Note that the corner points under the raised stage have not been
circled. They are not part of the room and won't be included in the model. We
are only interested in the inside of the room.</p>
<p>Please note that we placed the 0, 0, 0 point in the center of
the stage at the very rear of the room. In EASE we normally use either the back
of the stage or the wall behind the stage for y= 0. This places the Audience
Areas at negative y. This is desirable because (by de-fault) EASE aims
loudspeakers along the negative y axis. We strongly recommend that you follow
these conventions; otherwise some confusion (and accompanying waste of time)
may result.</p>
<p>Let's start. Go to the Main Menu and open the Model_1 room under
Edit Room. Maximize the screen if it isn't already maximized. The larger the
drawing, the easier it's going to be to work. The working area of the screen
will be displaying only the x, y, z axes icon, unless you decided to use the
Z-Grid.</p>
<p>The first Face we want to enter is the main floor. There are a
number of ways to enter a Face in EASE and before we finish the Tutorial we'll
try all of them. For now, we'll use the basic method which is to enter the
Vertices and then connect them together to form the Face. We'll be helped by
the symmetry feature of EASE because we will only have to insert 2 Vertices and
EASE will put in the other two.</p>
<p>Note: Most of the operations we will be performing can be
initiated through use of one of the Tool Bar icons, by a key command or by
using the Insert pull down menu. Both the Tool Bar icons and the key commands
will be used throughout the Tutorial to get you acquainted with them. The Key
Command will normally follow the command name in brackets, for example, <i>[F3]</i>.</p>
<p>Before we do this, make sure the <i>Show Vertex</i> icon is
activated (click on it in the Tool Bar) Unless Show Vertex is turned on, you
will not be able to see the Vertices as you add them. You may also want to turn
on <i>Vertex Labe</i>l. It will allow you to see the P numbers assigned to the
Vertices as you add them.</p>
<p>Now, click on the <i>Insert Vertex icon [V]</i> in the tool bar
and then on any spot in the screen. This will open the Properties sheet for the
Ver-tex. Type in the coordinates for the first Vertex (-25, -20, 0) and then
hit <i>OK</i>. Note that you can tab from one entry field to the next.</p>
<p><img width=340 height=230
src="E1.files/image073.jpg"></p>
<p>It's quite likely that after doing this you will be able to see
only one Vertex on the screen, even though you are working in the symmetrical
mode and EASE should have put in a second mirror image Vertex. It did, you just
can't see it! Either go to the tool bar section and click on the <i>Full icon
[Home]</i> or use the Scroll Bars <i>[F11</i>] to resize the drawing so you can
see both Vertex P1 and its mirror image Vertex P1*.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Adding the next Vertex is easy. Vertex P1 should still be
selected (highlighted in yellow). If it isn't select it and then click the
right mouse button and select <i>Duplicate</i> from the pop up Mouse menu that
appears This will open the Displacement window shown below (unless under
Options you changed the default settings under the Prompts tab.) It is asking
for the location of the new (duplicate) Vertex.</p>
<p><img width=571 height=223
src="E1.files/image074.jpg"></p>
<p>All you have to do is type in how far you want the Vertex moved;
in this case 55 feet down the Y axis (from -20 to -75). Enter -55. Approving
the move will introduce the Edit Vertex screen shown above giving you the
opportunity to check and approve the Vertex location. This is a quick way to
add Vertices, since you usually have to type in only one figure.</p>
<p>The Displacement screen also has a <i>Keep</i> check box and a <i>Repeated</i>
field. When <i>Keep</i> is checked the coordinate entries are stored and appear
the next time Duplicate/Displace is used. At times this can be a time saver.</p>
<p>The Repeated field allows you to repeat the Duplicate/Displace
operation a number of times. It's not used very often with Vertices, but is an
extremely useful feature when Faces, Objects and Loudspeakers are being
Duplicated/Displaced. We'll work with it later on in this Tutorial.</p>
<p>Note that the Displacement screen shown above also has three
fields for Polar Coordinates. These are used for angular displacements. If we
had wanted to displace the Vertex 5 feet at a 30 degree angle, we would have
entered 30 in the hor. field and 5 in the dist. field. The program would have
responded by telling you how far the Vertex would be moved in the x &amp; y
direction.</p>
<p>We'll be working with Polar Coordinates in this Tutorial. They
can be very helpful and you need to become familiar with what can be done with
them.</p>
<p>Note: While constructing the model, you will probably notice
that the coordinate numbers occasionally change slightly from the ones you
entered; for example, -20 became -20.01. EASE works in the Metric system and
converts to feet when the modeling is being done in feet. The variations are
the result of rounding.</p>
<p>At this stage you'll probably be able to see all 4 Vertices, but
not the x, y, z axis icon. <i>Zoom Out [F12] [Home]</i> until you can see the
icon. It's easy to become disoriented unless you can see the Axis icon. If you
aren't sure which Vertex is which, go to the Label Items tool bar and click on
the Vertex icon. This will add the Vertex numbers to the screen. We suggest
leaving them On.</p>
<p><b>Entering Faces</b></p>
<p>The next step is to create the Face that will represent the floor.
Go to the Tool Bars and click on <i>Insert Face [f]</i>. Then click on Vertex
P1, P1*, P2* and P2 in order. Note that a red Trace line follows the movement
of the cursor after you have selected the first Vertex. Get into the habit of
watching this Trace line as you enter Faces.</p>
<p>You will also hear a tone signal as you click on each Vertex.
This is the program's way of telling you that you selected the Vertex and not
somewhere close to it.</p>
<p>Note, if you did not previously select <i>Never Add Vertex</i>
while setting the Exit Project Options (page 51) and missed the Vertex, the
program will give you a Prompt asking if you want to add a Vertex. Since we
don’t want to add a new Vertex, answer No by hitting the Cancel but-ton. The
program is just letting you know you missed the Vertex.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=672 height=426
src="E1.files/image075.jpg"></p>
<p>As soon as the Face is completed a Create Face Prompt will
appear asking if you want to Save the Face. Note that you only had to define 3
of the edges of the Face before the prompt appeared. Ease put in the fourth one
for you.</p>
<p><img width=365 height=378
src="E1.files/image076.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that we used a clockwise rotation to enter the Face and
that the Face is outlined in yellow. Our using a clockwise rotation told the
program that we were entering a Face whose active (exposed) surface faced into
the room as we viewed it. The yellow outline indicates that this is the way the
Face is oriented.</p>
<p>To verify this (and to get a little practice), let's blow away
(delete) the Face we just created and enter it again using a counter clockwise
rotation. Answer <i>Yes</i> to the Create Face prompt and then <i>OK</i> the
Edit Face window that opens. We can delete the Face by selecting it and using
the <i>Delete</i> key on the keyboard or by using the UnDo tool in the Tool
Bar. This time click on P1* first, then P1, P2 and P2* in that order.. Notice
that after we finish, the Face is now outlined in white. Use the Invert Face
icon in the Tool Bar to invert it or use the Mouse Menu and se-lect Invert.
Note that the outline color changes from white to yellow.</p>
<p>Note: Many users pay little attention to the direction in which
they enter the Vertices into the Face and rely upon the outline color to tell
them whether it’s entered properly or not. If it’s not, they invert it using
the right mouse but-ton and the <i>Invert</i> command.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p>Now, reopen the Properties window for the Face. Right click on
the Face and then select <i>Properties from the</i> <i>Mouse Menu </i>The
properties window gives you the op-portunity to define the Face’s
characteristics, such as its color and its surface material.</p>
<p><img width=310 height=321
src="E1.files/image077.jpg"></p>
<p>To designate the color of the Face, click in the Color field
under Materials or on the . button beside the Color field and then select the
color from the color chart that appears. Don’t be surprised when the color of
the Face on the screen does not change. Face colors are visible only under
Rendering. Because of this, some users wait to add color to the Faces until the
model is complete. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>To apply the color change, click on either <i>Apply</i> or <i>OK</i>.
Apply will make the change, but not close the window. OK will make the change
and close the window. The green traffic light at the bottom of the screen
indicates the Checked status of the File and shows that the file is open to
accept changes. Left clicking on the green light will open a pop up screen
telling you whether the data is good or not. The yellow envelope indicates that
the file has been altered, but that the change has not been processed. Clicking
on <i>Apply</i> will process the change and wipe out the envelope.</p>
<p><img width=365 height=227
src="E1.files/image078.jpg"></p>
<p>To pick the surface material, click in the white Face field or
on the . button beside the Face field to open the Select Wall Material window
and then select the mate-rial you want to use. You'll notice that the only material
listed is the default Absorber. CARPTCOMM which is what we want isn't listed.
This means you will have to use the Browse button to locate the Material
database and find CARPTCOMM so you can add it to the data-base for this
project.</p>
<p><img width=369 height=309
src="E1.files/image079.jpg"></p>
<p>Pressing <i>Browse</i> will take you directly to the Wall
Mate-rials folder in the Select Project Database window. Browse to the <i>American
Base</i> and open the <i>Full</i> folder. Scroll through the list to find
CARPTCOMM, select it and then press <i>Add</i> to add CARPTCOMM to the Proj-ect
Database.</p>
<p>Follow the same procedure to add the other materials we will be
using in this project to the project database.</p>
<p>Then return to the Properties screen for the Face we in-serted,
choose CARPTCOMM and click on OK.</p>
<p>Don't worry about the other boxes in the Properties win-dow.
We'll cover them later.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Making Steps</b></p>
<p>Now, it's time to add the steps. This won't be as difficult as
it may sound. From the room description, we know the steps are 1 foot (12 inches)
high and 1 foot deep, so all we have to do is use the Duplicate feature to
create new Vertices and then move the Vertices in the Displacement window. We
don't even need to know the coordinates for the new Vertices.</p>
<p>Lets do it. Left click on Vertex P1 and then open the Mouse menu
by right clicking. Select <i>Duplicate</i> from the folder that opens, and then
change the z dimension by typing 1 into the z field and hit <i>OK</i>. This
brings up the Property Sheet for the new Vertex complete with the co-ordinate
information. All you need to do is <i>OK</i> it.</p>
<p>Warning; one thing you need to watch out for is that the
Displacement window which comes up carries the displacement data from its
pre-vious use. You need to check all the fields to make sure they are what you
want.</p>
<p>Note that the new Vertex assumes the P2 designation and the
Vertex previously labeled P2 become P3. When the Duplicate method is used to
generate a new Vertex, EASE assigns the new Vertex the next highest number
above the number of the Vertex being duplicated and renumbers all higher number
Vertices. Note that the same holds true when Duplicating other items, such as
Faces.</p>
<p>Now, right click on Vertex P2 and select Duplicate again and
move the y coordinate by 1 foot (type 1 in the y box). This puts in the bottom
rear Vertex for the first step as P3. To put in the Vertex for the front of the
stage, repeat the procedure and change the z coordinate by 1.</p>
<p>If you have trouble &quot;picking&quot; the Vertices or have
difficulty seeing them, use the Zoom tool to zoom in on them. Just click on the
Zoom tool icon and then use your mouse to draw a box around the area you want.
You also may want to use the Drag tool to move the drawing on the screen and
the scroll bars to enhance your view of the Vertices.</p>
<p>Now that we gone this far, we might as well put in the Vertices
at the back of the Chancel. Repeat the procedure and change the y coordi-nate
by 19. Click on <i>OK</i>. Your drawing should now look like this.</p>
<p><img width=653 height=408

<p>57</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>The next step is to create the Faces associated with these
Vertices. We'll use the same procedure we used to create the Face represent-ing
the main floor. Select the <i>Insert Face [F]</i> icon from the tool bar and
then click on Vertices P1, P2, P2* and P1* in that order. Use the Zoom feature
and the Scroll Bars to get a good look at the Vertices involved. If the Vertex
Labels obscure your vision, turn them Off using the Tool Bar icon.</p>
<p>Notice that you did not need to click on Vertex P1* to complete
the Face. The program made that connection for you. Now repeat the pro-cedure
to put in the bottom of the first step, the back of the step and finally the
floor of the stage.</p>
<p>If you have trouble seeing the Vertices for the back of the
Chancel (stage), use the <i>Drag tool [d]</i> to grab the drawing and move it
across the screen. Be sure to check the outline color of each Face as its
entered into the program to make sure it's properly oriented.</p>
<p>Note that if we were putting in more than a couple of steps, we
would probably have put in the Vertices for just the first step, created the
Faces and then Duplicated/Displaced the Faces to create the remaining steps.
We'll practice this later in the Tutorial.</p>
<p><img width=583 height=363
src="E1.files/image081.jpg"></p>
<p>We are now ready to build the walls. The first step will be to
put in the four Vertices that define the top of the walls (the bottom Vertices
are already in place.) Pick Vertex P5 and click the right mouse button, select <i>Duplicate</i>
and then change the Z coordinate by 10. Remem-ber the walls are 12&quot; high
and the stage is 2&quot; high. Repeat the procedure with P7 to put in the other
corner Vertex (P8 at -25, -75, 12).</p>
<p>Now, it's a simple matter of adding the wall Faces. Select
Insert Face [f] from the Tool Bar and then click on the Vertices that outline
the side wall facing you. ( Vertices P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8 and P7 for
example.) If you can't read all the Vertex numbers, use the Zoom tool to take a
closer look at any you can't read.</p>
<p>Note that all the Vertices that define the wall Face must be
included in the Face. Otherwise, a Hole in the model will be created and you
won't be able to Close the Room until the Hole is Fixed. This is important as
many of the acoustic simulations can't be run until the room is closed.</p>
<p>Now, check the outline color to make sure the wall is properly
oriented. The wall closest to you should be outlined in white. If it isn't (and
it won’t be if you followed the instructions), use the Invert Face tool to
correct its orientation.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=671 height=365
src="E1.files/image082.jpg"></p>
<p>Now it's time to put in the walls at the end of the building.
The Vertices are all in place, so all we need to do is to connect them together
to make the Faces. Notice that you have to separately enter Faces for both ends
of the room. The symmetry feature of EASE only mirrors from one side of the
symmetry plane to the other. It doesn't work along the line of symmetry.</p>
<p>All that remains is to add the top sections of the end walls and
the roof. We'll start by inserting the two Vertices that represent the roof
peaks. This time lets use the Insert Vertex [Insert] [v] tool. Select the tool,
click on any screen location to insert the Vertex and type the proper
coordinates (0, 0, 25 for the stage end and 0, -75, 25 for the other end) into
the Property Sheets.</p>
<p>We'll first do the top sections of the walls at the ends of the
structure. Select the Insert Face [f} tool and then click on the three Vertices
that make up the Face. Don't forget to select the surface material (WOODFLR)
and choose a color. While adding these Faces, note the Invert Order button on
the Property Sheet. This represents another spot where you can change the Face
orientation.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>All that remains is to put in the ceiling. Use the Insert Face
[f] tool to do this. Select Insert Face, then click on the Vertices defining
one side of the ceiling. Don't forget to check the outline color of each Face
after it's added. Your completed room should like this.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=340
src="E1.files/image084.jpg"></p>
<p>We’ve completed the basic room. Now would be a good time to turn
off our computer and take a break. At this point, the work you have done hasn't
been saved or sent to the Main Program module. The simple way to do this is to
use the F6 key command; another way is to open the File pull down menu and
select Save Project Data.</p>
<p>Now, close up the Edit Project module and then EASE itself. If
you didn't remember to save the changes before you attempted to close EASE you
saw a prompt reminding you the data hadn't been saved. Answering Yes to the
Prompt will exit the program without saving the changes to the Project file.
Answering No to the prompt will give you the chance to save the data by
selecting Save under the File pull down menu or, by doing a Ctrl + s, or by
using the Save Icon in the Tool Bar.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that you always do an F6
before closing down the Edit Project module and then a Ctrl S before you
attempt to exit EASE. Why take a chance?</p>
<p>In fact, a good habit to get into is to regularly hit F6 while
you are building a model.</p>
<p><b>Adding Seating Areas (Using the Coat Feature)</b></p>
<p>Open the model again, if it isn't already open. Although the
Seating Area Faces that represent the seating areas could have been added at
any time during the modeling procedure, we put off adding them until now so we
could treat them separately. We want to &quot;paste&quot; them on top of the floor
instead of modeling them into it. EASE calls it making one Face a Coat of
another Face. The reason we want to use this method is that it is easier to
paste or Coat a Face onto another than it is to model one Face into another.
Modeling the two seating area Faces into the floor would have forced us to
generate a number of smaller &quot;partial&quot; Faces; pasting the Seating
Area Faces onto the floor generates only 2 new Faces.</p>
<p>The basic room is now complete, so let's paste in the Seating
Area Faces. We'll do this the same way we originally entered the floor. The
coordinates are shown in the drawing on page 48. First, Pick the main floor
Face and make note of its Face number. You will need it soon. Then select
Insert <i>Vertex [v]</i>, type in the coordinates for one of the four Vertices
we need to add and then <i>OK</i> the insertion. The other 3 Vertices can be
entered individually using the <i>Insert Vertex [v]</i> command or by using the
Duplicate/Displace method to create and position them.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>As soon as all four Vertices are added, select <i>Insert Face
[f]</i> from the tool bars and use the cursor to create the Face. When the
Properties sheet appears put a check in the Two Fold Face box. We'll start out
using MTSEAT WD as the material to simulate an empty room. Don't worry about
the Rear material. The rear material is ignored by EASE as long as the Face is
being Coated onto another. Next, put a check in the Is <i>Coat Of</i> box and
then click in the white field to the right of the Is <i>Coat Of</i> box. This
will open a listing of the Faces included in the model, select F1 (the
program's designation for the main floor Face) and <i>OK</i> the selection.
Then <i>OK</i> the overall listing and the Seating Areas will be Coated onto
the floor.</p>
<p>Note: You may be wondering why we went to the trouble of putting
in two seating area Faces and then Coating them onto the floor Face, instead of
just Coating a single Two Fold Face over the entire floor Face. The main reason
is that EASE has trouble when the Vertices for the Two Fold Face and the Face
being coated are shared. EASE wants to put the Two Fold Face a small distance
above the Face being Coated and can't when the Vertices are common. EASE tries
to correct this by shifting Vertices and strange things happen.</p>
<p>You may notice at this point that the Face outline is neither
white or yellow; instead it's blue or orange. Orange is the default color for
the foreside of a Two Fold Face. The backside is blue. If you don't like blue
or orange, changing to other colors is easy. Go to the <i>Options [F9]</i> menu
and select the <i>Items II Tab</i>. Click in the color box for <i>Face Color of
Picked Two-Fold</i> and select a new color.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=340
src="E1.files/image085.jpg"></p>
<p>We could have also created the seating areas with the Insert
Rectangle tool. In this approach, we would have gone to the z (overhead) view
and used the xy grid to graphically place the Vertices. Shift + z would have
opened the Grid folder in the Options menu and allowed us to turn on the grid
and set its plane level to the floor level.</p>
<p><b>When you place a Face on top of another Face, the Face on top
must be a Two-Fold Face and you must tell the program that you</b></p>
<p><b>want to Coat (paste) it onto another Face. </b>EASE
needs this information to correctly calculate the total surface area of the
Room and to<b> </b>make sure a hole isn't put into the Room. If you simply
create a Face and place it on top of another Face without using the Coat Of
fea-ture, the total surface area of the room is inflated throwing off many of
the calculations.</p>
<p>Two-Fold Faces are also used to add barriers, reflectors and
absorptive panels into a Room. These do not need to be Coated onto a Face, as
long as they do not touch another Face. When Two Fold Faces are used for this
purpose, the Rear Face material is also taken into ac-count in the room’s
surface area since both Faces are exposed to the Room.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Adding Audience Areas</b></p>
<p>Audience Areas are the imaginary areas on which EASE normally
maps the system's performance. They are strictly measuring planes and have no
acoustical properties.</p>
<p>Because we included Seating Area Faces in our room model, it
will be very easy to add Audience Areas. Pick one of the Seating Area Faces and
then right click on it to bring up the Mouse Menu. Choosing <i>Area Above Face</i>
will add the Audience Area and bring up the Audi-ence Area Property Sheet.. All
you need to do is click on <i>OK</i> and the Audience Areas will be added. They
will be outlined in green. Notice that the program has placed them directly
above the Seating Areas at a height of 3.94 feet, approximately the height of a
seated listener's ear.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=340
src="E1.files/image086.jpg"></p>
<p>The scanning routine used by EASE in its area mapping module
requires four-sided areas, so this method of adding audience areas works only
if the Audience Area is being placed above a Face having four corners; i.e., a
square, rectangle or quadrangle. Otherwise, the Audi-ence Area will have to be
entered as a special area with four corners. Use the <i>Insert Area [a]</i>
tool bar icon and then enter the correct X,Y, Z coordinate information into the
Edit Audience Area Properties sheet.</p>
<p>The scanning routine also has difficulty plotting simulations on
4-sided areas that have one very short side. So, don't try to beat the pro-gram
by turning a triangular area into a 4-sided one by putting in a fourth point.
It won't work.</p>
<p><b>Adding Listener Seats</b></p>
<p>Listener Seats provide a convenient reference point for many EASE,
EARS and AURA simulations. They represent identifiable points for in-depth
acoustic investigations. They also represent good spots (seats) to sit in and
look around the Room using the graphic capabilities of EASE.</p>
<p>Listener Seats are easy to add. Pick an Audience Area at the
spot you would like to place a Listener Seat. Then right click to bring up the
Mouse menu and select <i>Seat On Area</i>. This will bring up a Properties
sheet for the Listener Seat; fill in the coordinate information and click on <i>OK</i>
and the Listeners Seat is added to the room model. Try it; it's simple to do.</p>
<p>You can also add Listener Seats with the <i>Insert Listener Seat
[c]</i> tool. Simply click on the <i>Insert Listener Seat</i> icon in the tool
bar and then on the spot where you want to place the Listener Seat.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>You can even draw in rows of seats if you want. Instead of
picking Seat on Area in the Mouse menu, choose <i>Insert Seat Grid</i>. This
will bring up two prompts; the first asking for Seat Distance X and the second
for Seat Distance Y. X is the distance between seats and Y is the distance
between rows. Using 3 for X and 4 for Y will produce the graphic shown below.
Notice that the seats are placed on the floor and not on the Audience Area.</p>
<p><img width=545 height=340
src="E1.files/image087.jpg"></p>
<p>If you feel the graphic is cluttered by all the seats, you can
turn off their display using the Switch Listener Seat On/Off icon in the tool
bar section or delete them by using the Undo command. A way to delete most of
them or another way to delete all of them is to use the <i>Show</i> <i>Listener
Seat Table </i>icon. This will open a table listing all the Listener Seats;
select the ones you want to delete and then under the<i> Edit </i>pull<i> </i>down
menu choose <i>Delete.</i></p>
<p><b>Closing a Room</b></p>
<p><img width=251 height=294
src="E1.files/image088.jpg"></p>
<p>We constructed our room in the Room Open modeling mode to speed
up the modeling process. Since the Room is now complete we need to “Close the
Room”. EASE can not run any simulations that require RT figures, such as the D/R
Ratio until the Room is closed.</p>
<p>Right click on the screen background to open the Mouse menu and
select <i>Room Data </i>to open the Edit Room Data window. Select the<i> Data </i>tab,
if it<i> </i>isn't already open, and click on the <i>Room Open</i> box to erase
the check mark.</p>
<p>Then click on <i>Apply</i> and <i>Recompute</i>. <i>Apply</i>
will “Close the Room” if there are no holes in it or any other problems. <i>Recompute</i>
tells the program to calculate the Room's volume, average absorption
coefficient and reverb times. Note that the program has now calculated the Room
Volume at 67,424.99 Cubic Feet.</p>
<p>If there are holes in the Room or other problems, an error
message will ap-pear giving you information on the nature of the problem.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Reverb Times</b></p>
<p>To see a tabular listing of the Reverb times, click on the Room
RT tab. Note that EASE has calculated RT60 times at 1/3 octave intervals from
100 Hz to 10,000 Hz using Eyring's formula. To see if Sabine's formula produces
similar results, change Eyring to Sabine and click on the Recompute button.</p>
<p><img width=236 height=277
src="E1.files/image089.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that there are small differences between the calculations
made with Sabine and Eyring formulas. Both of these formulas are generalized
formulas, meaning that they are not perfect in all applications. Sabine is
considered to be more accurate in larger rooms with homogenous distribution of
the absorbing materials while Eyring yields better results in smaller rooms
having a wider variety of surface materials.</p>
<p>You probably also noticed that under the drop down menu you used
to toggle be-tween Eyring and Sabine there is a check box for <i>RT Locked</i>
selection. This option allow you to enter measured RT data into the program and
Lock it into place. The measured RT data will then be used for all calculations
using RT times, instead of the data based on the wall material information and
the room volume and surface area. Measured RT data is recommended, whenever
measured data is available.</p>
<p>The File Folder and Floppy Disk Icons below the Lock check box
allow you to Save and Reload (Import) different RT curves.</p>
<p>The drop down menu RT tab also includes fields for Temperature,
Humidity and Air Pressure. These all have an effect on the calculations, so
don't ignore them.</p>
<p>EASE users can also use the Ray Tracing module to generate RT
times calculated using the Schroeder Back Integration method and then insert
them into the program. The Schroeder method is generally considered more
accurate than either Eyring or Sabine. The preferred method, however, is
measured data whenever it is available.</p>
<p>If you would like to see a graph of the RT Times, close the Edit
Room Data window to return to the Main menu and select <i>Room Info/Draw</i> <i>RT
</i>from the<i> View </i>pull down menu. Graphs created with both formulas are
shown below.</p>
<p><img width=628 height=331
src="E1.files/image090.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that even though the projected RT60 times are somewhat
different, both show a definite boominess at the low end. To see how much the
reverberation changes when the room is filled with an audience, change the
seating area material from MTSEATWD to PUBINWDT and then go back to the RT60
graph. As you can see, the room quiets down considerably when an audience is
present.</p>

<p><b>Finding and Fixing Holes</b></p>
<p>If you made no mistakes in building the Model_1 Room, It closed
without any problems. On the other hand, if you made a mistake some-where your
Room probably has a ‘Hole” in it.</p>
<p>The first indication that you have one or more Holes in your
model usually comes after you have Closed the Room and attempt to check data or
exit the Edit Project module. It usually takes the form of the Error message
shown below.</p>
<p><img width=260 height=113
src="E1.files/image091.jpg"></p>
<p>Holes are the result of violating one or more of the EASE
modeling rules. They are a sign that something isn't quite right and has to be
fixed before you can go on.</p>
<p>Finding Holes in a Room can be an exasperating experience until
you are familiar with the techniques involved. Eliminating Holes involved a
systematic search for the offending Face(s) or Vertices, determining the
problem(s) and then eliminating it(them).</p>
<p>EASE 4.3 will find most, if not all, of these problems for you
and then on command fix most of them for you. Even though EASE 4.3 will find
and fix most of these problems for you, it's important that you be aware of the
types of modeling errors that cause Holes. An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure.</p>
<p><b>Stacked Vertices </b>are one common problem. Stacked
Vertices is the term used to describe having 2 or more Vertices with the same
coor-dinate location. They are easy to create when the Duplicate command is
used to add Vertices. This leads to adjoining Faces having differ-ent Vertices
instead of common ones.</p>
<p>Stacked Vertices can be eliminated by a simple key stroke
command, Crtl + F12 which seeks them out and eliminates them. In fact, many
experienced users automatically hit Ctrl + F12 before they Close a room to
short circuit this problem. Try it. You can't lose.</p>
<p><b>Inverted Faces; </b>Faces whose reflective surface
is not facing into the room, are another common problem. The best way to
prevent them<b> </b>is to check their orientation as they are being created and
Invert them if they were inserted improperly.</p>
<p><b>Missing Faces </b>are another problem. It's easy
to miss inserting a Face or to inadvertently delete a Face, especially when you
are working<b> </b>late at night and tired.</p>
<p><b>Stacked Faces </b>are another possibility. This
term describes multiple Faces stacked on top of each other. It's easy to do
this when the Du-plicate command is used to create Faces.</p>
<p>The way to identify Missing Faces and Stacked Faces is to click
repeatedly in the offending area to verify that a Face was put in and that
extra Faces do not exist. The solution, of course, is to add any missing Faces
and delete any stacked Faces.</p>
<p>Missing or Stacked Faces can also bring up a <i>Non Zero Surface
Integral Error</i> message. Treat this Error message just as you would the Hole
in Room error message.</p>
<p><b>Two-Fold Face Errors</b>: Holes are also caused by
mistakenly using Two-Fold Faces where regular Faces should be used. This can
happen<b> </b>quite easily, if as you are building the model you put in a
Two-Fold Face as a seating area and then build the walls. The Property sheet
for the walls will open as a Two Fold Face and remain that way until you change
it back to being a regular Face. The color of these Faces when you select them
is your clue to this problem. Their border will be either white or yellow if
they are a regular Face and blue or orange if they are a Two-Fold Face.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Another common problem is forgetting to include all associated
Vertices into a Face. Remember, when we put in the walls for our Tutorial 1
building, we had to include in the wall Faces all the Vertices associated with
the steps. It is a must. If you followed the Tutorial and made sure the
Highlight Vertices of Picked Face was selected (see page 51), it should be easy
for you spot any mistakes by selecting the Faces and checking the Vertices.
Another way is to open the Properties sheet for the offending Face and compare
the Vertice listing to what should be listed. This can usually be easily done
by just counting the number of Vertices. If the Face should have 8 Vertices and
the listing shows only 6, you have found the problem. The solution, of course,
is to delete the Face and re-enter it, being careful to include all 8 Ver-tices
in the Face.</p>
<p>Reflectors or acoustical panels flown in the room must be Two
Fold Faces and must not touch the face of any of the surfaces. If they touch,
you have a hole. The obvious solution is to move them a fraction of an inch
away from the surface, so they don't actually touch it. Reflectors and
acoustical panels that are mounted on a surface must be Two Fold Faces that are
Coated onto the surface Face.</p>
<p>Now, lets go through the procedure for fixing Holes in EASE 4.3.
Open the Edit Project module, if it isn't already open and Invert one of the
side wall Faces. Now exit from the Edit Project program. This will bring up an
Apply Project Data prompt. Answering Yes will produce the Face Mismatch or Hole
in Room Error Message. Clicking on OK will introduce a Data Not Checked, Save
Anyway? prompt. Answering Yes will close the Edit Project module, answering No
will close the prompt and return you to the Edit Project window. Answer No.</p>
<p><img width=554 height=112
src="E1.files/image092.jpg"></p>
<p>Now select Check Holes under the Tool pull down menu. This will
bring up the following window.</p>
<p><img width=600 height=374
src="E1.files/image093.jpg"></p>
<p>The program has identified the problem areas for you and is
listing the offending Vertices and Edges. The list can be lengthy if there are
a number of holes. Selecting one of the listed Vertices will prompt the program
to identify the edge involved by turning it red. Sequentially clicking on the
listed Vertices will help you identify the offending Face.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Clicking on <i>Redraw Al</i>l will outline in red all the offending
Faces. This can be overwhelming if a number of Faces are incorrect, so use it
carefully. What it does do is show you the extent of the problem. Clicking on <i>Redraw
Edge</i> or in one of the Vertice listing boxes will return you to the single
Edge view. Notice that EASE will automatically center the offending Edge on the
screen for you, if you put a check in the <i>Center </i>box.</p>
<p><img width=595 height=371
src="E1.files/image094.jpg"></p>
<p>At this point, you can return to the Edit Project window just by
clicking on it and then take a closer look at one of the offending Faces. If
you see that it is turned around, use the <i>Invert</i> button to correct its
orientation and then return to the Check Holes window by clicking on it. If the
inverted Face was the only Hole, the Check Holes window will not open. Instead
you will receive a Well Done prompt.</p>
<p>If inverting the Face corrected the problem, but other Holes
still exist the Check Holes window will open. However, the Vertice listings
asso-ciated with the Hole you eliminated will have disappeared from the
listing.</p>
<p>You can use this technique to one by one eliminate all the Holes
in the model. The easier way is to let EASE do it for you. Notice that the
Close Holes section of the Check Holes window contains a listing of the
modeling errors that create Holes. Press the Close Holes button and EASE will fix
them for you.</p>
<p>The exception to this is missing Faces if your model has too
many of them. There is a limit to the miracles EASE can perform. Because of
this, it's wise to first let EASE fix the other modeling errors and then use
the <i>Redraw All</i> button to view the extent of the missing Faces problem
before using the Create Missing Faces command.</p>
<p><b>One other word of caution. </b>The Auto-Orientation
command will properly align all the Faces However, before using it make sure
that<b> </b>none of the Faces are selected. If a Face is selected, the program
will align all Faces with the one Picked. This doesn't represent a prob-lem if
the Picked Face is properly oriented. If it isn't, the program makes sure every
Face is improperly oriented and, in effect, turns the room inside out. The
program doesn't see this as a Hole and congratulates you on a job well done. At
the same time, however, it turns the room volume negative which interferes with
(prevents) many of the mapping simulations, such as ALCons. The solution to
this problem is to Invert one of the Faces so it is properly oriented, make
sure it is selected and then repeat Auto - Orientation.</p>
<p><b>Helpful Hint: </b><i>Shift + Ctrl + F12</i><b> </b>eliminates
all unattached Vertices. These don't cause a Hole problem, but can mess up your
drawing. They<b> </b>are often produced when a Face is deleted and the
associated Vertices are not. Many experienced users use the <i>Shift + Ctrl +
F12</i> key command to blow away unwanted Vertices whenever a Face is deleted.
It eliminates having to delete them one by one. Another technique is to use the
<i>Shift + Delete</i> key command to delete a Face. This command deletes both
the Face and the unattached Vertices.</p>

<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Adding Loudspeakers</b></p>
<p>Now, it's time to add loudspeaker(s) to the Room. This means
that the 'burden of proof&quot; has now shifted to you, the designer. EASE does
not decide for you what loudspeaker should be used , how many will be needed,
or where they should be located. You, the designer have to make these decisions
based on your knowledge and experience. All EASE can do is tell you how well
your choices will work.</p>
<p>Select the Insert Loudspeaker [l] icon in the tool bars and then
click on a location. This will open the Loudspeaker Property screen shown
below.</p>
<p><img width=417 height=335
src="E1.files/image095.jpg"></p>
<p>First, let's position the loudspeaker. A good spot to hang the
loudspeaker would appear to be at the front of the Chancel (stage) right on the
cen-ter line of the room. EASE places loudspeakers by a reference point that
represents the point of rotation used during the Loudspeaker measure-ments, so
we can't hang the loudspeaker at 25 feet, the height of the peak. Let's use 22
feet in-stead. Use the cursor and tab keys to insert the correct coordinate
information (0, -20, 22).</p>
<p>Another way to insert loudspeakers is to more fully use the
graphical modeling capabilities of EASE. In this case, use <i>Shift + z</i> to
select the overhead view and open the Editing window. Set the <i>Plane Value</i>
at 22 feet. Then, use the <i>[l]</i> key command to open Insert Loudspeaker and
use the overhead view and grid to insert the loud-speaker on the room center
line at the front of the Chancel.</p>
<p><img width=620 height=379

<p>68</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Next, let's select the loudspeaker we plan to use.</p>
<p>To choose the Loudspeaker, click in the white field under
Speaker Model or the . button next to it to open the Select Speaker window.
It will show only Sphere Sphere is the Default loudspeaker and not what we want
to use.</p>
<p>Use the <i>Browse</i> button to open Select Project Database and
select the Speaker Models tab. We want to use a Renkus-Heinz STX4/94, so browse
to the Renkus-Heinz/RHstx folder and select the STX4/94; then click on <i>Add</i>
and <i>Close</i>. While in the loudspeaker database, you may want to select and
add to the project file sev-eral other loudspeakers you would like to try. If
so, go ahead and do it. Note that we included a STX4/64 in our project
database.</p>
<p><img width=257 height=217
src="E1.files/image097.jpg"></p>
<p>Now, select the STX4/94 in the Choose Loudspeaker window and <i>OK</i>
the selec-tion. Then, hit <i>OK</i> to approve the insertion. You should now be
able to see a yellow horn shaped loudspeaker symbol above the front edge of the
stage and a wire-frame drawing of the STX4/94.</p>
<p>The spot identified as S1 at the base of the horn symbol is the
reference or rotation point for the loudspeaker. It's also the spot used to
Pick or select the loudspeaker. Zoom in on the loudspeaker if you have trouble
seeing the spot.</p>
<p>Note: If you can not see the wireframe drawing, it either is
turned Off in the Options folder or the database does not include a wireframe
drawing for the loudspeaker you chose. If you still have the Vertex labels
turned On, they may be cluttering the screen. Turn them off using the Show
Vertex Labels icon. You may also want to turn off the Grid. If you do, right
click on the screen, select Grids from the Mouse menu and turn off (uncheck)
the Z grid.</p>
<p><img width=218 height=254
src="E1.files/image098.jpg"></p>
<p>The loudspeaker symbol may be larger than you think it should
be. To change the size of the symbol, right click on the screen and then choose
<i>Room Data</i> from the Mouse menu. Select the <i>Settings</i> tab to bring
up the Loudspeaker Symbol dialog box.</p>
<p>Reduce the size (Width and Depth) of the loudspeaker symbol by
reducing the fig-ures in the white Loudspeaker Symbol fields, then click <i>Apply</i>
and <i>OK</i>. The <i>Apply</i> button gives you the opportunity to view the
result of the change before actually mak-ing it.</p>
<p>Now go to the Options window using the <i>F9</i> key command or
by clicking on the Op-tions button in the tool bar and then open the Items
folder. Notice the three radio but-tons (round check boxes). These allow you to
choose how you want the loudspeakers displayed on the screen. Try them out by
selecting them one by one and observing the changes on the screen after you hit
<i>Apply</i>.</p>
<p><img width=280 height=234
src="E1.files/image099.jpg"></p>
<p>Start by turning off the <i>Show Loudspeaker Symbols</i> and
checking the <i>Show</i> <i>Loudspeaker Cases </i>box. Then hit<i> Apply </i>to
add a wireframe drawing of the<i> </i>loudspeaker. (Note: This assumes you are
using a loudspeaker whose manu-facture has supplied wireframe drawings along
with his data.) The loud-speaker symbol will still show as it was Picked when
you started this exercise. However, as soon as you select another item, the
symbol will disappear. Now, to Pick the Loudspeaker you must click on one of
its Edges.</p>
<p>Next, make sure the <i>Show dB Coverage Cones</i> box is checked
and then put a check in the <i>3 dB Cov. Cone</i> box and click on <i>OK</i>.
These setups act as the master control for the dB Coverage Cones we'll be using
to aim the Loud-speaker and have precedence over any setups made in the
Loudspeaker Properties sheets. If the cones are turned Off here, they can't be
turned On in the Properties window.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Aiming Loudspeakers</b></p>
<p>Now, go to the Loudspeaker Property sheet (select the
loudspeaker and use the right mouse key to open the Mouse menu and then select
Properties). Put a check in the Show dB Cov. Cone box and OK the change. You
should now be able to see the coverage cone on the screen. The purple line
represents the coverage axis. The red lines outline the minus 3 dB coverage
cone. As you can see, EASE aimed the loudspeaker right down the Y axis and
straight ahead.</p>
<p>Note that you can also turn the dB Coverage Cone On or Off by
using the Show dB Cov. Cone option available in the Mouse menu.</p>
<p>We'll use the Loudspeaker Aiming option available in the Mouse
menu to re-aim the loudspeaker. Select the loudspeaker and then hit the right
mouse button to open the Mouse menu and choose Loud-speaker Aiming from the pop
up Mouse menu. This will open the window shown below. You are ac-tually looking
through the loud-speaker at its view of the room. The red line represents the
-3 dB down points, the yellow the - 6 dB down points and the green - 9 dB down.
As you can see they follow the loudspeaker's directivity pat-tern.</p>
<p><img width=486 height=304
src="E1.files/image100.jpg"></p>
<p>To re-aim the loudspeaker, all you need to do is click on the
spot where you feel the loudspeaker should be aimed. Notice that you can not
put the aiming point off to one side of the room. As long as the program is in
the Symmetrical mode, a loudspeaker positioned in the symmetry plane can only
be aimed down the Y axis. Everything wouldn't be symmetrical if the
loud-speaker was turned to the right or left or rotated. All you can do it
point it up or down, which in our tu-torial room is all we need to do.</p>
<p><img width=488 height=305
src="E1.files/image101.jpg"></p>
<p>If we wanted to get around this, there are two ways to do it.
One is to go out of the Symmetrical mode.</p>
<p><b>The point to remember about this is that once you leave the Symmetrical
mode, it's not a good idea to try to return to it.</b></p>
<p>It's possible, but not recommended. Too many strange things can
happen in the process. The other way is to move the loudspeaker a few inches
off the center line. This will introduce a second mirror image loudspeaker.
But, you can ignore it during the simulations by simply not turning it on.</p>

<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1

<p><b>Mapping</b></p>
<p>Although there are several ways to aim loudspeakers, most users
use Loudspeaker Aiming to quickly aim the loudspeaker(s) because it's so quick
and easy to use and then they fine tune the aiming while evaluating the
system's performance in Area Mapping. We'll go into the other loudspeaker
aiming methods when we cover Advanced Room Investigations later in this
tutorial.</p>
<p>The Area Mapping module is usually used for the fine tuning.
There are two ways to open the Area Mapping module. One is to return to the
Main Menu and select <i>Area Mapping</i> from the Calculations pull down menu.
The other is to use the <i>Ctrl + Alt + a</i> key command. Either way will open
the mapping window shown below. The two Areas shown are the Audience Areas we
put in several steps back.</p>
<p><img width=635 height=460
src="E1.files/image102.jpg"></p>
<p>The bottom row of tool bar icons (see copy below), except for
the four on the far right, are shortcuts to the wide range of simulations
avail-able. The four on the far right control how the results are presented.
We'll check them out later.</p>
<p><img width=679 height=56
src="E1.files/image103.jpg"></p>
<p>We are mainly interested in looking at the direct sound level in
the Audience Areas at this point, so click on the Direct SPL icon in the
bot-tom row of tools. This will open the setup window shown on the next page</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>This window and the ones that follow remind you of the
parameters that need to be set up before the simulation. The Settings tab is
where you select the frequency of the simulation, choose what loudspeaker(s)
will be used and decide upon the resolution (in feet or meters for patches and
in dB for Isoline maps). You also are presented with the choice of running a <i>Single</i>
map or of using the <i>All</i> <i>Mappings </i>feature.</p>
<p><img width=216 height=216
src="E1.files/image104.jpg"></p>
<p>When <i>All Mapping</i> is selected, the program gathers all the
data it needs to quickly display all the simulations avail-able at any
frequency. This is a great time saver when you are doing a detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Let’s use All Mappings and accept the default Resolution. All
Mappings takes only a few seconds longer and it gives so much more information.
All we need to do is to click on the Loudspeaker button and then turn the
loudspeaker <i>On</i>. Then click on<i> Next </i>to go to the second setup page<i>
</i>(Items).</p>
<p><img width=216 height=219
src="E1.files/image105.jpg"></p>
<p>The Items window lets you choose what Audience Areas and
Listener Seats will be included in the simulation.</p>
<p>Next, click on the <i>Aud. Are</i>a button and make sure both
Audience Areas are turned On. Then either open the Cal-culation tab or click on
<i>Next</i> to open the third setup page.</p>
<p>The Noise setup window which allows you to set the noise levels
that will be used in intelligibility calculations. Accept the default setting
for now.</p>
<p><img width=216 height=219
src="E1.files/image106.jpg"></p>
<p>The Calculations window adds further parameters to the
simulation. Here is where Shadowing can be turned On or Off. When Shadowing is
On, EASE take into account the shadowing effect of any objects in the room,
such as columns and balconies. When it's Off, it doesn't.</p>
<p>Under Interference, make sure Interference Sum and Third Octave
are checked. For now, leave the default set-ting for Split Time set at its
default setting.</p>
<p>All these options will be covered in detail later on in the Room
Investigation section of this tutorial. At the moment we are only interested in
aiming the loudspeaker.</p>
<p><img width=216 height=216
src="E1.files/image107.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, click on <i>OK</i> to run the simulation.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>Chapter 3: Constructing a Model</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>As soon as the simulation is complete, the screen shown below
will appear. We'll cover it features and functions in detail under Room
In-vestigations later on. For now, either minimize it or shrink it by clicking
on the <i>[–]</i> icon in the upper left corner.</p>
<p><img width=533 height=386
src="E1.files/image108.jpg"></p>
<p>This will allow you to see the complete Direct SPL map. See
below.</p>

<p><b>EASE 4.3 User’s Guide &amp; Tutorial</b></p>
<p><img width=665 height=1
src="E1.files/image004.jpg"></p>
<p>Notice that the color patches are quite large. This is a sign
the resolution we used was to coarse. Return to the Mapping Setup window by
clicking on the <i>Recalculate icon [!]</i> at the far left of the lower tool
bar and change the <i>Patch Size</i> to 1. Then, rerun the simulation. The
reso-lution will be much improved.</p>
<p>Our original coverage map also showed that the loudspeaker
needed to be reaimed. So, lets re-aim the loud-speaker. Return to the Edit
Project win-dow and select the loudspeaker, then right click and select <i>Loudspeaker
Aim-ing. </i>Re-aim the loudspeaker and then<i> </i>click on <i>F6</i> to apply
(send) the changes to the main module. Return to the Area Mapping window and
select <i>Acquire</i> <i>Project Data </i>under the<i> File </i>pull down<i> </i>menu
or use the <i>Ctrl + o</i> key command to update the Area Mapping module. Then
rerun the simulation. If you are happy with the results fine, If you are not
reaim the loudspeaker again and/or select a different loudspeaker and rerun the
simulation again. It only takes a few seconds.</p>
<p><img width=468 height=339
src="E1.files/image110.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that if you had returned to the Main window and selected
Area Map-ping for a second time you would have opened the area mapping module
again and been able to run a second map based on the new loudspeaker aiming.
This would allow you to com-pare the two maps side by side.</p>
<p><img width=472 height=342
src="E1.files/image111.jpg"></p>
<p>You can also quickly reaim, reposition or change loudspeaker
models using the Loudspeaker Properties folder.</p>
<p>Select the loudspeaker, then right click and select Properties
from the Mouse menu. Make the changes and then hit <i>Apply</i> to observe the
effect of the changes in the loudspeaker cover-age cone. If they look good, run
an-other map to see the results.</p>
<p>When they are satisfied with the direct sound coverage, many
users then use the intelligibility maps to do the final fine tuning. Just click
on the STI icon in the tool bar section and <i>OK</i> the setup windows as they
appear.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes right now to become familiar with this
portion of the program. Try moving the loudspeaker backwards and forward, then
up and down and observe the results. Try different loudspeakers to see what
effect this has. You'll have fun.</p>

<p>If you don't like the colors you originally chose or if you
didn't bother to add them when you were building the room, it's easy to add or
change them.</p>
<p><img width=462 height=342
src="E1.files/image114.jpg"></p>
<p>Return to the Edit Project Data window, Pick a Face and then use
the Ctrl + F2 key command to open the color assign-ment window for that Face.
Another way is to use the right mouse button to open the Mouse menu. Then
select Color from the pop up menu that ap-pears to open the color assignment
win-dow. Of course, you could also open the Face’s Properties folder and click
on the color bar.</p>
<p>If you see the color you want in one of the Basic Color boxes
click on it and then hit <i>OK</i>. It's that simple.</p>
<p>If you don't see the color you want, clicking on the color
closest to it will take you to that color in the color bar section. Then use
the cursor and/or the vertical color bar to find the exact color you want.
After you have made your se-lection, click on <i>Add to Custom Colors.</i> Then
click on the Custom Color you just created and on <i>OK</i></p>
<p><img width=464 height=348
src="E1.files/image115.jpg"></p>
<p>You can now assign this custom color to any Face by selecting
the Face and then reopening the color assignment window using <i>Ctrl + F2</i>
or the Mouse Menu.</p>
<p>An easy way to change the color of a number of Faces is to use
the Face Table. Use the <i>Show Face Table</i> Icon in the Tool Bars to open
the Face Table. Note that any colors you have assigned to Faces are shown in
the Color col-umn. Faces which do not have an as-signed color show only a number
in the Color column.</p>
<p>Go to the <i>Tools</i> pull down menu and turn on <i>Color and
Material Coupled</i>. Then select the color you want to change by clicking on
it in the Color col-umn. This will open the Color Assign-ment window. Select
the new color and click on <i>OK</i>. This will change all the Faces having
that Material to the new color. It's easy.</p>
